"Eidoscope","The garden, nestled within the depths of the subterranean galaxy, serves as both the lens to observe its great expanse and the Shorekeeper's dwelling during her confinement by the Tethys System. It is said that the garden existed well before the founding of the Black Shores, functioning as the eye that gazes upon the stars. However, what the eye perceives may remain unknown to the heart. What truths lie behind these supreme concepts?"

Its fall shall usher forth the world's inevitable ruin.
Frozen, torn asunder, consumed by flame... So be it, gaze now upon the world's end."

For centuries, the people of Hongzhen revere the Sentinel, who safeguards their town, as their god, praying devotedly for its blessing of lasting prosperity and longevity. Despite the year-round snowfall blanketing Mt. Firmament, the warm springs flowing from the mountains and the vibrant life of the townsfolk make the cold no more a concern."
"Mt. Firmament","A sanctuary in the southeastern seas of Jinzhou, sealed away beyond the reach of common folks in thick fogs.
According to ancient records, Mt. Firmament is the ancestral home of Jinzhou's earliest settlers. Sentinel Jué once descended upon this land, using the power of Temporal Mandate to protect it from Tacet Discords. Consequently, the flow of time within Mt. Firmament diverges from that of the outside world. 
In earlier times, scholars from the Court of Savantae were fortunate enough to uncover the mountain's hidden mysteries, leaving behind research facilities and invaluable records before vanishing without a trace."

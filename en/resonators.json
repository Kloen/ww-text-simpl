      "doc": "Evaluation Basis: [Resonance Assessment 1011-G]\n\nThe exact time and cause of Resonator Yangyang's Awakening remain unclear. Resonator Yangyang reports heightened sensitivity to her surroundings since her childhood.\n\nThe Tacet Mark of Resonator Yangyang is located in the center of her forehead. Post-Awakening observations found no notable physical change. As frequency fluctuations resurge, limited feather-like transformation have been observed on the ends of her hair.\n\nResonator Yangyang synchronizes with surrounding air by detecting information in air streams and creating an energy field using converging airflow.\n\nThe Resonance Spectrum Pattern of Resonator Yangyang displays over 20% resemblance to that of airflow and smaller bird species. While a strong Syntony reaction is present, the pattern also shares over 5% similarity with multiple other existing samples, indicating potential multiple or contaminating causes of Awakening.\n\nAnalysis of test samples has revealed a non-convergent Rabelle's Curve with a stable rise. Occasional fluctuations within the normal range have been detected. Therefore, Yangyang is identified as a Natural Resonator.",
      "certification": "The waveform graph for Resonator Yangyang displays stable elliptical fluctuations in the Time Domain with no abnormal patterns. Upon examination, all results fall within normal parameters. \nIn terms of Resonant Criticality, Resonator Yangyang ranks at a relatively low level with high stability. Examination results appear to fall within normal parameters with no risk of Overclocking. \nResonator Yangyang has a documented history of Overclocking. \nMaximum recorded Overclocking rating: Negligible.\nDuring the event, Resonator Yangyang experienced emotional overflow and temporary loss of Forte control. Fortunately, there were no casualties or hazards reported, though she suffered several comatose episodes due to the overstimulation. Further examination revealed that Yangyang's heightened perception was causing harm to her body through her Forte. The aftereffects have since stabilized, but the feather-like transformation on the ends of her hair remains irreversible. Yangyang's sensory overload has been managed and her emotional state is stable, with a positive prognosis. Routine examinations are recommended for monitoring purposes."

        "content": "In any social group, there are those who exude a convincing, reliable aura that convinces people they could achieve anything, despite not having started or done it before. \n\nYangyang is one such person.\n\n\"Yangyang? It seems... She can do everything so well.\" People would always say so. This trust probably stems from their experiences with her. \n\nSince childhood, Yangyang has excelled in her studies, including etiquette, music, literature, mathematics, and martial arts... She always ranked at the top in all subjects and exams every year. Even when encountering new knowledge or difficult problems, Yangyang never showed frustration; rather, she would actively try to solve any problem that came her way.\n\nYangyang was always chosen to give speeches at her school’s annual ceremonies. But, like everyone else, she would take a deep breath before speaking, hiding her nerves. Despite having some talent for understanding complex concepts, she lacked true genius. And while others may see her as successful and confident, she struggles just as much with everyday problems.\n\nIn her first swordsmanship lesson, she struggled to control her swings and execute proper techniques. Despite this setback, she resolved to work even harder. For the next two months, she practiced 100 times a day and sought guidance from experienced seniors, humbly acknowledging her weaknesses. She then continued to practice with a reflective mindset, improving upon the deficiencies pointed out by others. Eventually, her muscles adapted to the pain and she could withstand several strikes from an opponent.\n\nAnd in another two months, Yangyang, once again, emerged as the top student in her swordsmanship class.\n\nConcerned individuals tried to console Yangyang, reminding her that life is not perfect and that she should be content with the affirmation and praise she receives. But Yangyang would kindly reject this advice, knowing that her drive came from within and not from seeking validation from others. \n\nWas she giving her all? Was everything done to the best of her ability? These were the questions that consumed her. \n\nWith a smile and a gentle shake of her head, she would reject any advice to take it easy, determined to push herself to perfection with no room for regrets or shame.\n\n\"That's our Yangyang, doing amazing as always. We knew you'd make it!\" \n\nThat was when Yangyang became an Outrider and successfully helped resolve a regional TD crisis. People praised her excellence as usual.\n\n\"Yes, I did it this time, but how about next time? There are still so many things I could have done better; so many things I don't know. Perhaps I should go seek advice from senior members of the Midnight Ranger...\"\n\nBeing consistently reliable is daunting, yet crucial. It takes relentless effort and dedication.\n\nYangyang is determined to give her all to achieve this goal. She strives to be the one others can seek help from anytime, and won’t stop until she succeeds."

        "title": "The Secret to Listening",
        "content": "Most people didn't know that Yangyang had a perfect pitch. \n\nPerhaps it was because how she was always a passive presence, never singing in public or taking the spotlight. She preferred to stay in the background and listen. It seemed like she was born to be a listener.\n\nThat's why Chixia was shocked at Yangyang's ability to accurately hum a melody she had only heard. She couldn't help but exclaim, \"How did you memorize that so fast? And it sounded amazing! Good heavens!\"\n\nSuddenly, everyone remembered Yangyang's other identity, the second daughter of a family of music. It would be only unnatural if she didn't understand music theory or know how to sing. \n\nThis revelation resolved some of the previous confusion. That perfect way of dealing with people, that etiquette which seemed faultless to even the most demanding people. Yes, of course, she had to come from such a well-educated family. \n\nHowever, it also begged another question: Why would the daughter of such a renowned family go to the border city alone, at the expense of her otherwise luxurious life and promising career? Was there an underlying reason that compelled her to leave? \n\nIf there really was such a reason, Yangyang never mentioned it to anyone. She never complained or avoided responsibilities, whether when she fulfilled her Outrider responsibilities, or when she spent time with friends. If one had to say, it was her Outrider companions that bothered her more, because... She was always patiently lending an ear.\n\nMany sought solace in confiding to Yangyang, not seeking solutions but simply venting their stress. She knew this well and remained neutral, empathizing with the narrator's feelings. She listened without interruption, offering guidance when needed before returning to a silent role. With her help, the tangled emotions were untangled unnoticed. These cathartic sessions proved valuable. However, Yangyang's support was not blind agreement; she offered advice prioritizing the speaker's desires.\n\nSoon enough, Chixia told everyone else about Yangyang's amazing talent, sparking playful requests for a song.\nYangyang shyly waved off their request, saying, “Maybe... I'll sing it for everyone later, when I am ready?” \n\nYangyang looked sincere, so it seemed not just perfunctory or an excuse. It was truly what she thought from the bottom of her heart. But when would that be? Perhaps she wanted to wait until everyone else who wanted her to hear out their worries had finished talking?\n\nUnderstanding and critiquing performances requires a deep knowledge of music. \nHowever, being skilled in music does not necessitate taking the stage. \n\nSo thought Yangyang, as she again chose to step back, allowing others to shine."

        "title": "The Secret to Believing",
        "content": "To some extent, there isn't much difference between the sixteen-year-old Yangyang and the six-year-old Yangyang.\n\nShe still holds the same expectations for the world, believing in fairy tales as always, believing in the goodness between people, believing in miracles, believing that all things beautiful will eventually happen.\n\nMany would call this naive luck, the thoughts of a spoiled child who has never faced the harsh realities of life.\n\nIndeed, Yangyang grew up in a privileged and nurturing home, shielded from suffering. Her life was perfect...\n\n...Until that fateful day.\n\nAt age 11, her tranquil life was shattered by a ruthless attack from Exiles while traveling with her family’s caravan. The brutal reality of death and cruelty left her reeling as she fled and sought refuge among strangers in an unfamiliar settlement. These resilient people lived off the land, cautious yet resourceful. She was forced to fend for herself, adapting to this harsh new world at a young age. She couldn’t tell if they were like the ruthless attackers or not. The constant alertness of these settlers made her question if it was safe to trust anyone. Dressed in fine clothes and alone, she stood out among them, and they too were suspicious of her. Could it be a trap?\n\nIn the end, they passed food to her, and she took it, though she'd never seen anything like it.\n\nKindness found its roots even in the most barren of lands. Yangyang wanted to repay the trust they released before her, but her knowledge proved not helpful at all in the wild, and her sword skills proved too childish against real hostility. Everything seemed entirely unfamiliar to her, yet this was the harsh reality most people had to face. The reality felt so overwhelmingly agonizing.\n\n\"Grandma, have you... been living like this all the time?\" As Yangyang tried to help an old lady sort out the meager resources they had, she couldn't help but ask this abrupt question.\n\n\"Yes, why? City girl. You shocked? Relax. Everything will be fine.\"\n\n\"But when? Will things really be fine one day?\"\n\n\"Of course. How will good things come true if you don't even believe them yourself? We were skeptical of you, too, but we chose to believe. It's the same for you. Gotta have faith in something in life. Even if you don't know how it'll turn out. That's what faith is all about.\"\n\n\"When? Hm, maybe when you grow up, little one.\"\n\nSo yes, perhaps Yangyang hasn't experienced enough hardship yet. Or maybe one's inclination to show kindness isn't based on past experiences, but inherent in their character.\n\nIn the darkest of situations, some will show kindness simply because others choose to trust them. And this in turn will spark more acts of goodwill.\n\nEver since, Yangyang always spread kindness to strangers, sparked by that one encounter.\n\nOf course, her kindness is not without boundaries. Betrayal can turn her warm breeze into a harsh storm.\n\nBut she holds onto hope, believing in the power of goodness. She chooses to trust and expects the best from others. This is her chosen way to make the world a better place."

        "title": "What Wind Taught Her",
        "content": "Yangyang had fallen into the winds three times.\n\nThe first time was when she fell from her mother's arms.\n\nShortly after Yangyang's birth, she was already surrounded by love. Her mother playfully swung her in her arms, pretending she was flying and landing. \n\nBut when the swing went a little too high, Yangyang felt the whispers of wind and sensed an approaching storm, even before she could speak. As she landed, her babbling was mistaken for fear from the accident, but it was actually a reaction to the oncoming tempest.\n\nThe second time was when she passed out from sensory overload.\n\nAs she grew up, Yangyang's once vague sensing ability strengthened, allowing her to feel intangible airstreams in her palms. She called them the \"Streams,\" and they gave her insights into energy fluctuations, anomalies, and even the smallest physical details of a person. \n\nTrapped in a self-destructive cycle, Yangyang yearned to explore her ability and gain more insight. But the more she tried to be thorough, the deeper she fell into a maze of details.\n\nWhat followed cannot be called a fall, for it was a descent through time, not space. The sensory overload lasted for months, between faintness and sobriety. Yangyang felt as light as a feather caught in a raging storm, perpetually falling.\n\n\"I must focus on the key details within my reach, rather than trying to capture everything...\" Finally, Yangyang pulled herself out of the never-ending free fall and safely landed.\n\nThe third, but maybe not the last time, was when Yangyang leaped up and threw herself into the winds.\n\nThe continual sensory overload altered her hair and taught Yangyang to tolerate the discomfort. Despite the Streams' excessive information, the recipient could sift through and extract crucial details. Signs of a struggle at the disappearance site, unusual fluctuations outside the city, and a steady rise in energy reactions...\n\nYangyang had never used her ability in such a dire situation, but her determination to help overrode any hesitation. The Streams surged, forming a distinct line that led to a missing child, being chased by TDs and teetering on the edge of a cliff. Without hesitation, Yangyang leaped towards the precarious figure, outstretching her hand to save the child.\n\nFeathers danced in the air, carrying Yangyang and the child in a gentle yet powerful wind. The child looked around at the floating feathers and asked, “Are you the lark fairy that flies in the wind, miss?” \n\nLost in memories, Yangyang smiled. She thought of the times when she fell into the winds, again and again. Perhaps she truly was one with the winds."

        "title": "Answer Lies in the Winds",
        "content": "On her journey away from home, Yangyang met two kinds of people.\n\nThe first kind always seemed in such haste, yet remained unsure where they were heading, and often ended up lost and returned in regret. The other kind always had a clear destination in mind. They always made it finally, despite arduous roads and occasional stumbles. Yangyang held up her head and looked at Jinzhou city on the horizon, unsure if she could be considered one of the second kind of people. Once again, she thought of the term \"One Instrument for Life.\"\n\n\"One Instrument for Life.\" That is the most important principle in Yangyang's family teachings. Originally, it meant that every family member could strive to excel in everything, but they must choose one musical instrument to specialize in and practice continuously throughout their life to become a master. As circumstances changed, the principle gradually evolved into dedicating one's entire life to one pursuit, striving for excellence to make this life worthwhile.\n\nHer mother's Instrument was composing. Yangyang had seen people dancing to her mother's songs. On the other hand, Yangyang's sister was already a successful figure in the chamber of commerce.\n\nHowever, Yangyang could not easily decide on her own Instrument as they once did. What was the thing worthy of dedicating her life to? What person should she be?\n\nShe turned to her mother for help: Mother, do you want me to inherit the family business? Or, what do you want me to do? I can try anything and I will strive for excellence. Although life is full of infinite possibilities, in the end, we can only choose one path, right?\n\nHer mother looked at her with love and said, my child, it is precisely because of this that you should not seek answers from me, but rather ask your own heart. This is a difficult question, but you need not rush an answer.\n\nAnd so, Yangyang held onto her question, waiting patiently for an answer that seemed to elude her. She waited through her returning home from the desolate settlement, through the climbing out of an abyss, and through growing weary of her family's overprotectiveness. Her desire to join the world and experience its harshness grew stronger, no longer content with being a mere leaf drifting in the wind. She longed to bear the weight of reality, instead of hiding away from it.\n\nThat was when a sudden ambush in the wilderness resulted in heavy casualties from Tacet Discord attacks on the frontline. News of this tragedy quickly spread through the city, igniting feelings of sorrow, anger, and despair among its inhabitants. Emotions boiled over, with people gathered around a bonfire. Tears flowed freely, hoarse cries echoed through the night. But by morning, grief became a luxury as life returned to normal. \n\nYangyang stood among them, tears streaming down her face. She hadn’t experienced any personal loss, but witnessing their sorrow and the joy of the rescued children stirred something inside her. It was a transformative moment, as she realized her true calling: to protect others, just as she had been protected before. She wanted to shield them from misfortune and give them hope for a brighter future.\n\nAs Yangyang stood at the edge of Jinzhou on her enrollment night as an Outrider, she gazed at the sky and the bustling residents below. Doubt crept in as she questioned her ability to protect these lively citizens, a responsibility she had always dreamed of fulfilling.\n\nThe Streams came from afar and gently held Yangyang in their embrace, dispelling her last bits of doubt.\n\nThey silently whispered: Jinzhou is the place. It is the destination for Yangyang the wealthy daughter, and the beginning of her journey as Yangyang the Outrider."

A strong Syntony reaction has been observed, yet the cause of Chixia's Awakening remains unclear.\n\n\nAnalysis of test samples has revealed a non-convergent Rabelle's Curve with a steep rise in the middle section. Resonator Chixia is thereby classified as a Mutant Resonator.",

The family is well-known for their deep passion and expertise in the world of spices.\n\nAs the sun painted the Jinzhou skyline with its morning light, the first sign of activity would always come from Panhua's Kitchen, where plumes of smoke billow from its chimney.\n\n\"Mornin', Mrs. Panhua. A bowl of handmade noodles, please. Extra numb and spicy.\" A loud and clear voice overshadowed the rising hustle and bustle of the city outside the kitchen, immediately capturing the attention of several children nearby, their eyes lighting up with admiration.\n\n\"Miss Chixia, when are we having today's Overdash lessons?\" one of the children asked eagerly.\n\n\"Your students look more psyched than you are,\" Panhua teased as she served Chixia and the children their breakfast.\n\n\"What's the hurry, I'm not even warmed up yet! Plus, ya can't work on an empty stomach,\" Chixia replied between mouthfuls of spicy noodles.\n\nFor her, an energetic day begins with a spicy tingle to the taste buds.\n\nChixia relished each bite of spicy chili peppers, washing them down with steaming soup. Her body glowed with warmth as the food settled in her stomach.\n\nWith the last slurp of noodles, Chixia wiped her mouth in satisfaction.\n\n\"Now I'm all fired up!\""

Their names invoked courage and comfort. She dreamed of making her own heroic name, one that would be remembered. Whenever she helped someone, Chixia always made sure to leave her mark, even teaching children to write down her name one stroke at a time.\n\nAnd just like that, her name has spread throughout Jinzhou like wildfire. Her name has become a staple in the city, with people constantly calling out \"Chixia\" wherever they need help. Foreign merchants, unable to speak the local language, mistook \"Chixia\" as a customary greeting. Since everyone is shouting it, so why not follow the trend?\n\nDespite her unwavering determination and fiery passion, Chixia still has her worries. She has been bravely battling bandits, Tacet Discords, and those suspicious figures in red on the outskirts of Jinzhou. But dangers always surface in unexpected ways, despite her efforts to protect the city.\n\nHas she truly lived up to the standards of a hero in everyone's eyes? Despite her doubts, Chixia finds solace in the smiles of those she protects. In that moment, all worries dissipate in an instant.\n\nOn the other hand, the children of Jinzhou don't care about all of that. In their games of play-pretend, they have already given the hero's role to their fiery big sister Chixia."

But her favorite technique is the Kindlefire move, symbolizing Fiamma's grand entrance. A torch is lit in darkness, shooting a fiery ball into the sky and igniting surrounding candles. The audience is mesmerized by this stunning display, as the faint smell of burning wood fills the air. \n\nIt was a familiar light and a familiar smell, one that always takes Chixia back to her childhood. She remembers journeying in the wild with her parents, setting up camps as they migrated to Jinzhou. At night, the wilderness was treacherous. The silent darkness swallowed everything in its path, including Chixia's small tent where she huddled for safety. In the dark, Chixia clung to her blankets and recited the hero stories mother read her before bed, hoping for Fiamma's protection against the lurking Tacet Discords. Soon, a small fire flickered in her mind. Little Chixia's gaze fixed on the tent's fabric wall, captivated as the flame grew brighter and brighter...\n\n\"Look! It's Fiamma!\" Jiu in the seat next to her shouted excitedly as he tugged at the corner of Chixia's shirt, bringing her attention back to the stage.\nAnd lo, the majestic Fiamma descended from the sky with a triumphant wave of his torch, causing the wicked Fluffernox to flee in a hurry. The crowd erupted in applause, with Chixia clapping the loudest of all.\n\nAfter returning home from the theater, Chixia readied for patrol and grabbed a plain torch before heading out.\n\n\"You're still holdin' on to that doodad? I've lost count of the years you've had it. Didn't the department give you a lot of new equipment and stuff?\" Chixia's mother remarked as she spooned a generous scoop of hot sauce into her stir-fry.\n\"No worries!

As she scanned the area, a crumpled Fiamma clipart caught her eye, hidden between roof tiles.\n\n\"...?\"\n\n\"...Score!\"\n\nAs Chixia was about to crouch down for a closer look, an unexpected shadow leaped out of nowhere, giving her a startle. She quickly directed her torch toward the stranger, only to see the face of a small child. Taking advantage of Chixia's moment of confusion, the child snatched the clipart from her hand before quickly disappearing into the boundless dim of night.\n\nChixia rushed over for a quick check, but that child was already gone without a trace.\n\nShe continued her search all night until the break of dawn, when she reached a half-open window and heard a child singing, \"Once I pick up the Torch Sword...\"\nThat's one of Fiamma’s lines! Chixia followed, \"I will eradicate that monster!\"\n\nA small head poked out of the window, his bright eyes shining with the excitement of finding a fellow fan.\n\nSince they were both Fiamma admirers, it made things a lot easier. After all, a person who loves Fiamma can't be a bad person!\n\nJiu's family had recently moved to Jinzhou, and with his parents working long hours, he and his sister were often left alone at home. His sister was timid and always worried that there was a Fluffernox on their roof. Therefore, to protect his sister, Jiu would patrol the rooftops every night.\n\n\"It's a shame I never got to see Fiamma in person,\" Jiu said with a hint of embarrassment, \"I've only heard those lines from outside the theater. I didn't get them wrong, did I?\"\n\n\"Not at all. You nailed it!\" Chixia reassured him. \"You should definitely take your sister to the theater and see how Fiamma kicks Fluffernox butts for yourselves. I guarantee you she won't be scared afterward.\"\n\n\"I... I'll pass. Mom and dad are already having a hard time as it is...\"\n\n\"Here, promise me you'll stay away from the roofs from now on. It'll make my job a whole lot easier, and in return, I’ll get you tickets to the plays. Deal?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am!\""

She was also well-known for her unwavering pursuit of heroism. Many people were under the impression that Chixia was aiming at a higher position, and her choice left them scratching their heads.\n\nWhen asked about her decision, Chixi would simply respond with a wide smile, \"I just can't leave Jinzhou. The spicy noodles, the theater, and my friends: Jiu, Qianqian, Ali...\"\n\nBut the real reason behind her choice was a tale too intricate for words. Only Chixia knew the depths of her decision.\n\nThe spark of her dedication was ignited during her childhood, fueled by her family's torches, and intensified by the heroic images she saw in the theater. On a particularly dark and stormy night, that spark almost went out, but it was reignited to its brightest by a bolt of lightning.\n\nThat day, young Chixia bravely wielded a torch, pretending to be Fiamma as she tried to scare off the bandits. But her attempts were futile as one of them picked her up and threw her next to her captive friend, Ali. Chixia opened her arms to shield Ali with her body, her eyes shut in fear. Suddenly, a deafening bolt struck, and when she timidly opened her eyes, lightning crashed down on the bandits, causing them to tumble and fall.\n\nIn the midst of lightning flashes, she saw the bright badge her savior wore. \nYears later, Chixia finally passed the entrance exam for the Public Security Bureau, hoping to follow in those heroic footsteps. However, the enigmatic person who wielded that lightning had vanished without a trace. As time passed, she came to understand why that person must stay hidden, and why she wasn't suited to become one of them.\n\nAnd so, she looked at the option for \"Community Patroller,\" the least sought-after role, and placed a resolute checkmark next to it. Though she couldn't become the lightning, there is still something she is best suited to do: to safeguard the simple yet precious everyday lives of civilians."

      "doc": "Evaluation Basis: [Resonance Assessment 1916-G]\n\nAccording to Resonator Verina's reports, she has had significant exposure to botanical samples since childhood and is able to audibly detect their frequencies. The timing of her Awakening is unknown.\n\nVerina's resonance frequency shows an increasing trend over time, leading to speculation that her Forte abilities will also continue to strengthen with age. The extent of this growth is still being monitored.\n\nResonator Verina bears a Tacet Mark below her clavicle. Following her Awakening, physical changes have been noted, such as the emergence of vines on both ears and dorsal spine.\n\nThese vines form a symbiotic relationship with Verina and assist in converting her resonance frequency into Spectro energy for efficient storage and release during use of Forte.\n\nAdditionally, Verina's Resonance Spectrum Pattern aligns with known patterns of plant life. Strong Syntony reaction have been recorded during testing, yet the exact cause of Verina's Awakening remains inconclusive.\n\nAnalysis of test samples has revealed a non-convergent Rabelle's Curve with a noticeable periodic waveform. Therefore, Verina is classified as a Congenital Resonator.",
      "certification": "The waveform graph for Resonator Verina displays stable elliptical fluctuations in the Time Domain with no abnormal patterns. Upon examination, all results fall within normal parameters. \nIn terms of Resonant Criticality, Resonator Verina ranks at a relatively low level with high stability. Examination results appear to fall within normal parameters with no risk of Overclocking. \nAnnotation: Resonator Verina's emotional state and volitional level are generally very stable, and only fluctuate slightly and briefly when she is situated away from the natural environment. Test results indicate her symbiotic plants are capable of transmitting a special frequency band to Verina, which aids her in returning to a stable state of mind. This is a rare case in the relationship between a Resonator and the symbiotic plants and serves as a useful reference for related research."

        "content": "“If you’re asking about Verina. Boy, you’re in for a story,” When asked about Verina, Riggs, leader of one of the Pioneer exploration teams, always begins with these words, “When she first came aboard our team, she was always by herself and didn’t really talk to people. We were all worried about her, since she had lost her parents...”\n\n“We couldn’t help but feel sad for her. She was so young, but already had it rough in life. And she was such a kind girl. We loved exploring, but it’s no walk in the park. But Verina never complained. She did all the hard work like mountain climbing and getting water by herself. She even went scavenging for food without being asked. She was such a big help to us, but we worried about her keeping everything bottled up inside for too long... what if something happened?”\n\n“Until one day, something actually happened. And it was funny, to say the least. One of the lads on the team really liked mushrooms and went out to pick a few for the soup he made. Verina held on to that pot and wouldn’t let it go as if her life depended on it. By the time we got over to them, they were already in a shouting match.”\n\n“The lad was bragging to Verina about his wildlife experiences. Hell, don’t know what’d gotten into his head, thinkin’ he could out-talk our little botanist! Verina had all the mushrooms spread out and started naming out all the rings, caps, and butts of each and every one of them. Being out exploring for so long, we all caught on that she was telling us the mushrooms were poisonous. She’s got more knowledge of them than any of us, even gave us a lecture on the spot, teaching us how to tell them apart one by one. Now that was a lesson.”\n\n“After she was done, she even tapped on a piece of wood she found somewhere like an instructor, and asked if we understood it all. We looked at each other and blinked dumbly, then burst into laughs, which drove her nuts.”\n\n“W-why are you all laughing... Did I get something wrong? Eugh... Sob...” She was so panicked that she started picking out the mushrooms still in the pot and went over them again one by one, but we were already all clapping for her. And then I yelled, “Bravo! That’s our little botanist, folks!”\n\nEver since then, Verina would still think of that day and feel super embarrassed; she’d put her head inside a mushroom pot if she could. But she’d still give her opinions carefully and patiently whenever it came to anything plant-related."

        "title": "Cultivating Flowers",
        "content": "The people of Jinzhou love flowers.\n\nDuring tense battles, the military often requested extra bouquets with their supplies. These orders would end up in Verina’s hands, which felt strange at first.\n\nThe bouquets bloomed for only a short time. Those picked today would wilt tomorrow. A bouquet that blooms in a greenhouse may have withered petals by the time it makes it to its recipient. At this point, the flowers would have already lost most of their beauty in people’s hands, so why the need for them?\n\nUntil one day, she read the wishes attached to one of the orders. \n\n“In honor of my comrade in arms. He gave his life for the peace of Jinzhou, yet his name is not known to many. Yet I still remember his heartfelt smile when he received an Iris from a friend long ago. If one’s name cannot be remembered, let the meanings of these flowers honor him forever.”\n\nThat night, Verina locked herself in the greenhouse.\n\nFlowers are adored for their intricate leaf patterns, but it’s the fleeting feelings they evoke that truly captivate us. Verina carefully selected and cultivated the finest seeds, preserving those precious emotions in her garden.\n\nShe longed to preserve the stories and emotions associated with each bouquet, wishing for them to last beyond their natural lifespan. She hoped that by doing so, recipients would experience the true essence and beauty of the flowers, igniting a deeper connection to the emotions they held within.\n\nIt was at these times that Verena wished she could work a little harder and a little longer."

        "content": "People always ask Verina why she loves plants so much. It’s a question that Verina has answered countless times, but she knows that people will always start off the conversations with question after question, so each time she would give out her well-thought-out answer: “When I was little, my mom would place two pieces of leaves in my hand and ask me what the differences were between them.\n\nI would reply, ‘Aren’t they exactly the same? They came from the same tree.’\n\nAnd Mom would shake her head, ‘Look closely, Verina.’\n\nSo I gave them a closer look, and then I realized that even though they looked the same on the outside, their veins spread out in varying directions. They drew completely different patterns.”\n\nThis changed Verina’s perspective entirely, the differences which she had never noticed nor cared about in the past were now displaying right before her eyes.\n\nSome flowers may look similar but grow in completely different environments. Some trees or plants may grow in near identical environments but end up taking on various shapes.\n\nVerina was captivated by the similarities and differences among plants, spurring her passion for botany. She meticulously studied their traits to help them thrive in different environments and cultivate stunning flowers. Through this, she also began to notice the unique qualities of those around her. Just as every leaf is distinct, so are people and experiences. Verina observes her friends closely, noting their preferences and sorrows with care.\n\n“For example, some people like to eat Lemongrass and some people don’t. It must feel nice to have someone remember their preferences.”\n\nWith this sentiment in mind, Verina carefully and conscientiously jotted down every little thing about her friends."

Often, Verina would wake up to find dried seedpods in the petri dish after a night’s rest. And then after working tirelessly all day, she would realize she had skipped her lunch again. In these moments, she missed her parents dearly.\n\n“If Mom and Dad were still around, I wouldn’t have to worry about all this...” Verina thought. A hot, hearty lunch would be right there waiting for her as she walked in the door, and she would get all the help she needed in time whenever she wanted to figure something out. But all of that had long since become a memory, left in the notes that she had lost when she departed the New Federation a long time ago.\n\nNow she would have to pull herself together and live on her own.\n\nSometimes, she wondered: Is there any meaning to all the work I’ve done? Is there any meaning in the life I’m living?\n\nBut then, she would always find the answer in her thriving plants.\n\nDespite the struggle, the dry seedpods continued to produce new life and their growth whispered tales of perseverance and joy into her ears. As she nestled herself in this green oasis, Verina could hear the plants sharing their stories of pain and triumph, reminding her of the beauty of growth and blooming.\n\nPerhaps this was the meaning of her endeavors. Verina thought as she stood up and put on her gardening gloves again.\n\nEven if her parents aren’t by her side, she is still determined to keep working hard and show them how much she’s grown.\n\nAfter a brief moment of sorrow, she picked up the spray can and carried on with her day’s work."

She cleared her mind and grabbed her adventure notes to explore the streets of Jinzhou.\n\nJinzhou was a far cry from her hometown in the New Federation. No inflated flower prices or elaborate competitions here. As she strolled through the bustling alleyways, Verina was struck with a sense of genuine relief. The steam rising from vendors’ stalls and the busy shoppers around her brought a comforting normalcy to this new city.\n\nThis is good, this is good. As she walked along the road, Verina thought to herself. Memories flooded her mind of studying plants with her parents, and the painful loneliness she felt after their absence. But now, standing on her own two feet, she could finally treat herself to a peaceful vacation. After what felt like an eternity of walking alone, she had grown into her own person.\n\nAnd then she saw her friends waving to her: Chixia and Yangyang were walking towards her with freshly purchased Salted Milk Tea in their hands. The Midnight Rangers must be taking a little vacation as well. Verina hurriedly rummaged through her satchel, pulling out a few bouquets of tiny, star-like flowers from it.\n\nThis was the most precious gift Verina would ever give her friends. The selection had taken far, far too long, and while the Star Flowers had waited for the best of times and sunshine, she had also waited for sunshine that would make her feel warm.\n\nNow that she saw her sunshine, Verina ran toward her friends.\n\nThere was a long road ahead, and it would take some time for the flowers to bloom.\n\nAnd for now, she is content to enjoy the vacation."

The later Tacet Discord encounter during a blizzard caused by Waveworn Phenomenon left frequency erosions to her right eye, leading to Sanhua's abnormal vision and the subsequent Awakening of Forte.\n\nResonator Sanhua's Tacet Mark is located in her right pupil, only visible when she exerts her Forte. After analyzing Sanhua's testimonies and medical tests, we've pinpointed physical changes following her Awakening. These include a chaotic frequency reaction of her right pupil near the Tacet Mark, appearing red. The erosion is also advancing, evident in the color shift from grey to red in her left pupil.\n\nSanhua has gained abnormal vision and control over snow through her Forte, its strength tied to her focus. After analyzing her explanations, our initial conclusion is that her sight differs from the norm, allowing her to perceive object frequencies directly. Frequency tests show 99.64% accuracy in her visualization.\n\nSanhua's Resonance Spectrum Pattern is identical to that of the snow. Additionally, the spectrum patterns of her pupils are identical to the Frequency Fluctuation interval of known TDs. Both tests revealed strong Syntony reactions, and the exact cause of her Awakening remains unclear.\n\nAnalysis of test samples has revealed a non-convergent Rabelle's Curve with a steep rise in its middle section. Therefore, Sanhua is classified as a Mutant Resonator.",

Examination results are determined to be within normal parameters. However, Sanhua's risk of Overclocking persists.\n\nResonant Criticality: Very stable. Yet constantly verges on the Criticality level. Risk of Overclocking remains high.\n\nResonator Sanhua has a documented history of Overclocking. Maximum Overclock rating: Moderate.\n\nSanhua's past Overclocks caused Level 2 blizzards due to her extended periods of verging on Resonance Criticality and extreme Frequency Fluctuation reactions. No civilian casualties were reported in these incidents. These series of events are currently documented under code EX01521, classified as Class 3 hazard events.\n\nSanhua's frequency fluctuates due to erosion, causing energy outbursts and altered perception. Her Overclocking leads to quicker erosion spread and changes her left pupil from grey to red.\n\nDue to Resonator Sanhua's past Overclocking tendencies, close monitoring of her psychological and physical condition is advised. Routine counseling and examinations are required."

She stands tall and poised, hidden in the periphery of others' gazes, like a sharp blade ready to be unsheathed at any moment.\n\nAlthough the majority of voices opposing Jinhsi have already subsided, there are still a handful of individuals who would attempt to challenge her authority. Because Jinhsi still held the title of Jinzhou's Magistrate, the seemingly blunt and inflexible bodyguard by her side seemed the easier target for pressure. Or so they assumed. \n\nRegardless of how impossible the ill-intended demands sounded, Sanhua can always flawlessly execute them to the utmost perfection. \n\nWith her impeccable time management, sharp intellect, cool under-pressure demeanor, and savvy negotiation skills... even the harshest critics were left stunned.\n\n\n\nAs the Magistrate's bodyguard, Sanhua handles both unruly daytime guests, and those uninvited guests who lurk in the shadows.\n\nBeing Jinzhou's Magistrate, Jinhsi is a prime target with a high price on her head. Unwelcome guests sought more than just a cup of tea, but they would soon learn their mistake: instead of hot tea, they were met with the razor-sharp blade of her bodyguard. The crimson-eyed bodyguard seemed to possess an uncanny ability to detect lies. Within seconds, she transformed into a fearsome Asura ready to strike. \n\nOne quick slash revealed shivering limbs as severed trouser legs fell in the cold air. This alone was enough to scare off most of the unwanted guests. Naturally, once the blade returned to its sheath, all shadows and shady dealings would be erased. Jinhsi's radiance would remain untainted, free from contamination.\n\n\n\nBut sometimes, even Sanhua meets surprises in life... \n\n\"Hello. You must be Madam Magistrate's bodyguard?\" \n\nSo asked the strange resonator standing before her, who bears the same beautiful human-shaped frequency as Jinhsi.\n\nHer world was suddenly filled with new ripples."

The sight was both awe-inspiring and horrendous, as the entrenched TD loomed over the devastated landscape, \n\nboth divine and demonic in its presence. It resembled a giant statue of the Asura.\n\nThe Midnight Rangers did everything in their power to finally defeat the colossal TD. Finally, it collapsed and disintegrated in piercing roars. While cleaning the battlefield, they were shocked to find a frozen infant amidst the wreckage, her body cold and tinted blue.\n\nThe infant was still breathing faintly. \n\nNo one could imagine how she could have survived such a cataclysm, nor did anyone have the time to ponder such thoughts. The Rangers wiped the bloodstains from their hands and carefully lifted her from the rubble. They shouted, \"We found a baby! A survivor! She's alive!\" \n\nTheir excited cries echoed far beyond the frontlines, instilling courage in every soldier and spreading their love for life across the battlefield, a comforting balm for their worn-out spirits. People believed this to be \"a miracle of divine favor\".\n\nSeveral days later, the girl rescued from the depths of hell opened her captivating odd-colored eyes for the first time. Tacet Discords did not take her life, but instead corroded her right eye. The lingering frequencies miraculously reconfigured themselves into a new eye, allowing her, who was born blind, to directly see the frequencies of all things in the world. \n\n— Unbeknownst to everyone back then, it was also a \"Curse of the Lament\". \nThe curse distorted everything in her eyes into grotesque, eerie, and cacophonous apparitions, disturbing her senses and shattering her perception of existence in the world. She saw no lies, but neither did she ever see light. \n\n\nShe relived that snowy night endlessly, struggling to escape hell only to fall back into it again, until she became an Asura herself. In a way, she was never truly rescued from that battlefield. Her world was a painting of purgatory, and she was doomed to be haunted by the Tacet Discords for the rest of her life, unable to break free."

A chilling aura always enveloped her, cutting her off from others. Passersby were wary of the inexplicable frostbite it caused. \n\nShe was vigilant, dangerous, and unreadable. It might be hard for others to imagine that someone like Sanhua would have recurring nightmares about snow.\n\nIn her dreams, she was always lost in endless darkness, searching for a field of snow, or a glimmer of light. But in the next instant, she would be lying on the snowy ground, surrounded by twisted monsters. They gnawed at her as she lay among hundreds of shattered corpses. As they gouged out her eyes, darkness descended and only their flickering shadows remained. And then she woke up with a start.\n\nAs she grew older, her Forte became increasingly powerful. The restless demon lurked within her, urging her to follow TDs' instinctive hunger to consume frequencies: the power of snow became harder for her to contain, and even the frequencies between humans and TDs grew ever so challenging to distinguish. \n\nAt times, Sanhua thought she had escaped the nightmare, only to realize she was still trapped within and had been transformed into a monster. Was it her lack of compassion or the harshness of the snow that caused this? Or maybe, she was simply a part of the snow all along.\n\nConfronting an inevitable fate entwined with demons, Sanhua embarked on a journey of self-imposed exile. \n\n\nRecently, Sanhua still dreamt of the snow. \n\n\nSanhua never needed lights in her room; she could see perfectly in the darkness. So when she was jostled awake from another nightmare and noticed the presence of light, she immediately realized that it must be Jinhsi still working on her documents. \n\n\"Forgive me, my lady...\" Sanhua apologized for not fulfilling her duty. \n\nA young woman was writing vigorously at the lamp. Noticing movement, she raised her head, \"I believe I asked you to rest up, Sanhua. I couldn't finish half by tomorrow morning without your help. You stayed up all night sorting them out.\"\n\n\"My lady, you must rest. Please let me handle these.\"\n\n\"Please, Sanhua. Would I really let you handle those boring papers alone? Not a chance.\" Jinhsi pondered for a moment, then offered a mischievous smile, \"If you want to help, just stay and chat with me for a while. I'll be finishing up soon.\"\n\n\"Of course. What would you like to talk about? Shall I recite the Heart Sutra for you?\" \n\n\"Oh, then tell me what you dreamt of? I believe I heard you mumbling in your sleep.\" \n\n\"Perhaps I was reciting the Heart Sutra in my dream, then.\"\n\n\"...Do we have to keep going back to that? Truth be told, working on these documents does begin to tire me...\" \n\n\"Hmm... I dreamt of you, my lady. You were standing in the snow... You looked beautiful.\" \n\nSanhua responded with a warm smile. Her journey ahead was no longer alone."

She journeyed to remote mountains and plains, gazing over a desolate, uncharted expanse from a cliff.\n\nShe witnessed star-shaped fissures spread across the land — The Tacet Marks, from which TDs continuously were hatched. They corroded the land humanity relies on for survival, like how they once corroded her eyes. \n\nSanhua tried to slay the monsters but found no solace. The never-ending chaos of noise tormented her, day and night. Her only motivation was survival, pushing her forward despite the constant assault on her senses.\n\nShe was like a kite floating atop the wilderness, guided only by a thin thread that would seem to break at any moment. She let the snow pummel her, lost and directionless. Wherever she roamed, blizzards would ravage everything in their path. She became a calamity. \n\nAs word of Sanhua's notoriety spread, people came after her. She didn't know who they were, or why they were trying to kill her. She somehow realized she must contain the devil within, but panic always prevailed and she would always fight before fleeing in distress.\n\nUntil one day, she was cornered and trapped in the mountains. It was then that she finally \"saw\" the snow – a golden shower of radiant snowflakes, like petals falling from the sky. \n\nThe sight was mesmerizing. She forgot her dilemma and pain, drawn by a deep, magical voice that calmed her mind. As the blizzard cleared, she found herself surrounded by golden snow. A man appeared and revealed himself to be the abbot. She soon realized it was all an illusion meant to enlighten her.\n\n\"All conditioned phenomena are like a dream, an illusion, a bubble, a shadow; like dew or a flash of lightning. Thus one should contemplate them in this way. What you perceive as suffering, yet you do not know that suffering leads to salvation... Only with one's karma, may one's cause and outcome arise.\"\n\nSanhua barely understood the meaning of those words, yet she did not attempt to escape. The abbot accepted her... or rather, she was captured and taken into the temple, like a stray cat. No one could have predicted that she would be tamed not by force, but by the silent falling flowers and a piece of advice. \n\nIn the temple, she was bestowed the dharma name \"Sanhua\". She practiced swordsmanship and recited the Heart Sutra daily with the other monks.\n\nSanhua wondered: If karma helps hatching every cause into its fated outcome, then to what outcome will her own karma lead her?"

Years ago, they took her eyes and her once-home, when she couldn't fight back. But now, she was on the battlefield as a warrior, with the snow as her curse, as her blade.\n\nHer eyes were starting to strain from the overwhelming TD frequencies, and her ears were filled with deafening screams. Through the blizzard, she saw a horrific sight that resembled her previous nightmare, one that she hadn't dreamed of in years.\n\nHundreds of corpses piled together to form a massive Asura before her, but upon closer inspection, she recognized the faces of those she called companions...\n\nShe was trapped in an illusion, watching helplessly as the demon within her consumed her with vicious force. Her abilities, once a source of power, now controlled and devoured her. The curse that gave her strength seemed futile against the overwhelming force of the Lament.\n\n\"...In the end, nothing ever changed.\"\n\nSanhua collapsed from exhaustion, overwhelmed by monsters and hallucinations. She muttered quietly to herself as she hit the ground.\n\nShe lost count of how many injuries she had sustained, only feeling warmth slipping away from her. She was back in the nightmare of her childhood, lying once again on that snow field. Coldness consumed her body as she melted into the icy ground.\n\nAs the world descended into a state of complete silence and darkness, a fleck of white entered her blurry vision.\n\n\"...Snow...\"\n\nSanhua reached out, longing to touch that coldness, but her fingertips were greeted by warmth instead.\n\n...No, it was not a snowflake.\n\nSanhua struggled to blink as the clear sight of a young woman gradually emerged in her vision. It was a frequency she had never seen before.\n\nThe young woman stood before Sanhua, shielding her from harm. Lightning seemed to flow at her fingertips. The chaotic blizzard that swirled around Sanhua was drawn towards her, and she guided those frequencies, gradually bringing them to stability. The seasons changed around them, distant thunder and winds signaling its arrival. Like a divine child responding to prayers, she eradicated all the Tacet Discords with her dazzling lightning. \n\nFollowing the melting of ice, the piercing cries in Sanhua's ears gradually subsided. She no longer heard the painful screams of the battlefield, but the sounds of blowing wind, chirping birds, and the rejuvenating earth. It was at that moment when she finally broke free from that snowy night, and the once-frozen time started flowing again in her life.\n\nThat was when Sanhua finally understood what karma had in store for her.\n\"Only with one's karma, may one's cause and outcome arise.\" Jinhsi has shown Sanhua the power of rebirth in destruction. Jinhsi... She may be the guiding light for all people during this devastating time.\n\nThe future Jinhsi has demonstrated is precisely where her fate lies. The light she has been pursuing in the darkness all this time.\n\nSanhua took up her blade again. This time, she has transformed her demons into the power for protection."

That new Director at the Ministry of Development's Defense Division doesn't let anything get past her!\" This rumor spread quickly through Jinzhou, soon becoming the city's hot topic.\n\nThe Ministry of Development ordered a batch of materials intended for the construction of a new defense line, but one container was filled with unlabeled, subpar goods. To complicate the matter even more, the batch had three different manufacturers, none willing to take responsibility for the defect.\n\n\"Director Taoqi, you have to help us sort this out. The Ministry of Development can't just accuse innocent people!\"\n\nThe three representatives said, their voices growing louder in an attempt to attract more attention.\n\nTaoqi calmly navigated through the commotion, while softly putting off the noisy representatives. \"Alright, alright, I understand,\" even though she wasn't really paying attention to their complaints. She then crouched down to inspect the unlabeled container. After examining a few pieces of materials for a while, Taoqi seemed to have an idea. In a casual tone, she turned to the three representatives and said, \"But it seems one of you is lying. Or perhaps, all three of you are.\"\n\nAfter that, Taoqi and her junior, Xiaoyu, discreetly visited three manufacturing factories. They gathered clues about the machinery, transportation routes used that evening, and delivery schedules. With this information, Taoqi was able to solve the puzzle and ensure those who had been deceitful would face consequences.\n\nWithin days, rumors spread throughout the city. One of the three representatives was interrogated by Director Taoqi of the Ministry of Development. Then, news surfaced about another representative being caught, followed by the final one. Eventually, Jinzhou News broke a story revealing their collusion in supplying substandard materials. The public was left stunned, while only Taoqi and Xiaoyu knew the truth.\n\n\"I know! It-it's the typical prisoner's dilemma! You brought one of them in for a 'private talk' first, then you made sure the other two knew what happened. All of this was meant to put pressure on them so they'd betray and tell on each other, right? But how did you know they were all lying?\"\n\n\"People can lie, but machines can't. Each factory has its unique machine specifications. The answer was already clear when I examined those materials. Oh well... it did cost me several lunch breaks.\" Taoqi complained as she pulled her sleep mask down, determined to make up for those lost breaks."

For her, it marked the beginning of another ordinary day.\n\nThe streets were bustling with breakfast stalls and the working crowd was already queuing up. Some left money and snatched a bag of buns in a hurry to get to work. No need for stall owners to raise their voices, everyone was eager for a quick bite before heading off.\n\nJinzhou, after a good night's rest, sprang to life again.\n\nAmidst the bustling crowd, Taoqi emerged at a leisurely pace. Her sleep mask was still worn on her forehead, and she was yawning from time to time, looking as if she hadn't fully woken up yet.\n\n\"Hmm... which line should I join?\"\n\nRubbing her eyes, Taoqi sized up each stall and silently counted, \"Three, two, one...\"\n\nUpon completing her counting, the person at the front of the queue left with a bag of freshly baked buns in hand.\n\nTaoqi seemed to be counting the time needed to steam buns at each stall. After checking the time and the number of people in the queues, she made her decision.\n\n\"Hmm... Great. Bet I won't be late today.\"\n\nTaoqi gently tapped one hand against the other on a tempo to track the time. As the queue inched forward, she noticed that her tempo of \"three, two, one\" was slightly ahead of the queue's progress.\n\n\"Oh? Looks like I might not make it on time, after all.\"\n\nTaoqi was determined to clock in on time, but her counting didn't match the queue's progress. She checked her tapping speed and confirmed it was accurate. Was the stall owner slowing down? She cautiously observed them, their hands moving in a blur. Confused, she couldn't figure out the reason for the inconsistency. Time was ticking, and she really needed to get to work on time.\n\n\"I see. This must be the issue?\" \n\nAfter a while, her attention was drawn to a child's pinwheel and then back to the stove, where a large hole allowed the wind to spread the fire. But the vendor didn't seem to notice.\n\nTaoqi left the queue, grabbed a box, and shielded the fire from the wind.\n\n\"Excuse me, young lady, what are you doing?\"\n\n\"Just trying to not be late!\"\n\nTaoqi explained with a satisfied grin as she returned to her original place in the queue. However, it seemed she would have to queue up again.\n\n\"Oh my, I'm definitely going to be late now.\""

She believes in letting people work it out themselves.\n\nShe brought her bewildered junior to a busy street market, the same one she helped improve for easier community access and better city planning. Taoqi urged him to observe everything on their stroll: the sights, sounds, and tastes of the street. She explained that by paying attention to the locals and their conversations, they could uncover hidden issues that really needs addressing. The junior thanked Taoqi with a grateful smile, having realized her intention. Taoqi smiled warmly in return.\n\nTaoqi is everyone's \"reliable big sister\", both in work and in everyday life. \n\n\"Ms. Taoqi, please...\"\n\nA certain storage space, once Taoqi's private nap haven, has been transformed into a comfortable \"chat room\" with a cozy sofa, perfect table, and delicious tea. Her junior colleagues now often come for her consultation during their free time. \n\nTaoqi lounged lazily on the sofa, listening patiently to her juniors as they opened up about their worries. \n\n\"You know what? The housing prices here have risen again!\"\n\n\"Indeed it has.\" \n\n\"Gotta work harder to repay the mortgage, but the thought of this stresses me out so much. I feel deflated...\" \n\n\"Same here...\"\n\n\"Sigh... Time flies by so fast. It's about time to go back to work...\" \n\nPerhaps this chatroom's popularity simply stems from it being a place for young people to spill their troubles and find solace in each other.\n\nAs for Taoqi, she only needs to be a patient listener, understanding their worries and offering advice when appropriate to gently lighten their burdens."

So, they turned to Taoqi for help.\n\nFeeling stressed and overwhelmed, Taoqi took a break on a swing nearby. As she watched children playing in a sandpit, an idea came to her - just like how they filled the gaps in their sandcastles, they could also fill the gaps in the frontlines. She proposed building a sand wall at the frontline during Tacet Discord assaults. This would shorten the frontlines and limit the attack paths for the enemy. With fewer spots to defend, the Midnight Rangers would have more time to assess each attack and respond accordingly based on the varying frequencies caused by sand deformation. Thanks to Taoqi’s clever thinking, they were able to better protect themselves against attacks and gain some much-needed breathing room on the frontlines.\n\nAccording to Taoqi, staring at a desk all day leads to monotony and disconnect from reality. So she seeks alternative methods for efficiency. It’s in her free time that she stumbles upon unexpected guidance and inspiration through serendipitous encounters."

      "doc": "Evaluation Basis: [Resonance Assessment 2190-G]\n\nResonator Baizhi experienced her Awakening four years ago, after being exposed to a strong Remnant Energy source one year prior. This exposure caused the activation of the corresponding Remnant frequencies within her. According to Baizhi's recounts, she experienced a strong urge to revive a teammate during her Awakening. As a result, the aforementioned frequencies manifested as a Remnant Creature that now serves as her companion.\n\nResonator Baizhi's Tacet Mark is located on the anterior side of her right thigh. No significant physical alterations after Awakening have been observed. \n\nHowever, when exerting her Forte, the Tacet Mark emits a faint white glow with the advent of the above Remnant Creature. The creature is translucent white in color and resembles the petals of Epiphyllum. It is unable to vocalize in human language, but can communicate with Baizhi through telepathy.\n\nResonator Baizhi cannot directly utilize her Forte, but she can leverage the extremely low temperature and her Remnant Creature's healing abilities to treat injuries in her vicinity.\n\nResonator Baizhi's Resonance Spectrum Pattern does not resemble any known frequencies. However, it shows a certain level of similarity with the fluctuations of Remnant Energy, and it possesses a strong Syntony Response with \"You'tan,\" her Remnant Creature. Despite these connections, the cause of Baizhi's Awakening remains unclear without adequate theoretical evidence.\n\nAnalysis of test samples has revealed a non-convergent Rabelle's Curve with a gradual increase followed by a steep rise in its middle section. Resonator Baizhi is thus classified as a Mutant Resonator with a Dormant Period.",
      "certification": "The waveform graph of Baizhi illustrates an elliptical fluctuation with a stable Time Domain. No abnormal parameters are observed in the test sample.\nResonant Criticality: High. Resonator Baizhi's frequency displays high stability with currently no risk of Overclocking.\nBaizhi has no documented history of Overclocking which reduces the necessity for counseling. Due to the strong bond between Baizhi and her Remnant Creature, regular examinations on the Remnant Creature's status are recommended to mitigate any potential latent risks."

        "content": "When mentioning Baizhi, her colleagues in the Academy would often remark that she seemed cold and difficult to approach.\n\nDespite working in the same department, she was rarely seen engaging in casual conversation or joining in on shared frustrations or moments of levity. Instead, they would find her calmly and methodically analyzing data, seemingly lost in her own world of processing logic. She exuded a cool and collected aura, making it difficult for others to connect with her on a personal level.\n\nBaizhi's presence brings a quiet stillness, isolating her from the bustling crowd. This reflects her lazer focus and self-discipline in her research.\n\nBaizhi's schedule is meticulously planned: Mondays and Wednesdays are reserved for monitoring the artificial Sonoro Sphere, Fridays are dedicated to analyzing Remnant frequency bands, and the rest of her time is spent on field research, observing Remnant biology, and integrating cases. She adjusts her plan as needed, moving forward with precision and purpose.\n\nBaizhi remains composed and self-sufficient, unfazed by unfinished work or challenging problems. She diligently studies until she grasps them with ease. This sense of calm makes it hard for others to approach her. With a cold expression and a distant tone, she unintentionally creates a feeling of distance. People can't help but imagine themselves being pushed away.\n\n\"Your report for the previous week was not submitted before its designated deadline.\"\n\n\"Ah... Yes... I, uh... The original Remnant samples were contaminated. I had to...\"\n\n\"Uhh, I'm sorry! No, I'm deeply sorry for my negligence! I... I'll make up for...\"\n\nSeeing Baizhi approaching closer and closer, the reporting researcher nervously clutched his clothes and subconsciously bowed his head even lower. But the next moment, a processed sample slice was handed to him.\n\n\"I presume samples from a Fission Junrock would suffice?\"\n\n\"But, that's your work...\"\n\n\"You may complete your report before the stasis-evolution. Having anticipated this potential scenario, I have allocated adequate time to mitigate any deviation.\"\n\n\"Please inform me ahead of time should any analogous scenarios occur in the future. You were... trembling intensively just now. May I suggest increasing the ambient temperature?\"\n\nHer pair of emerald eyes finally revealed a pure and unconcealed sense of confusion.\n\nThe researcher was stunned, then suddenly remembered the other half of the sentence about Baizhi that the other colleagues had added—She seems cold and difficult to approach, but that's just how she seems to be."

        "title": "The Sphere and the Device",
        "content": "A small sphere began to roll, then fell down a curve, and the end of the lever tilted upwards, showcasing the transmission of force.\n\n11-year-old Baizhi observed the sphere as it once again stopped at its predetermined spot. She concluded that no matter how complex it may appear, the sphere would always roll uncontrollably to its destined end according to the device's design. This brought to mind a theoretical hypothesis from a recent book: Throughout history, human civilizations have failed to break through the bottleneck of this apparatus and inevitably meet their downfall. No exception.\n\nIf the results are always consistent, then isn't everything that has ever happened only a predictable repetition? Is there truly a meaning to it all?\n\nBaizhi was consumed by this question, and her parents shared her concern for a different reason. While her passion for knowledge was admirable, Baizhi's obsession with theoretical concepts had distanced her from reality. She spent hours poring over esoteric texts and conducting simulations instead of enjoying life or making friends.\n\nSome days later, Baizhi received an invitation to the Huaxu Academy's scientific expedition base. That afternoon, she saw a device larger and more intricate than any before—components symbolizing different variables, intricately connected like a complex organic system. Yet, despite its grandeur, the device was still incomplete and too uncertain to become her \"sphere\" in what she was planning to achieve. With pensive eyes, Baizhi examined each part and formed hypotheses on how it functioned.\n\n\"How do you like it? Our team plans to finish building this someday.\"\n\nThe group's leader, who triumphantly returned from one of many grueling scientific expeditions he led, smiled warmly at Baizhi.\n\n\"Right there... If designed in such a way, the remaining energy will not be adequate to support the further distances, thus the information cannot be transmitted.\"\n\n\"Aah. So you've spotted its problem already... The Director was right about you. You really are talented! What say you? Do you want to join us?\"\n\n\"Any rolling sphere will only end up in one way: to ultimately stop at a certain location. But I fail to see where your design will end up in.\"\n\n\"I would say, it will be in a place... unknown now, but can be made known one day? I agree there must be an endpoint. As to where it should end up... Well, maybe you can join us to find the answer. Together.\"\n\nAs he finished speaking, the half-opened door suddenly burst open, revealing the rest of the team who had been hiding behind it. They stumbled into the room, their faces a mix of embarrassment and eagerness for Baizhi's response to join their mission.\n\nAt that moment, Baizhi thought she heard a faint crackling sound of a sphere being placed into its starting point."

        "title": "A Close Encounter",
        "content": "In her fourth year on the scientific expedition, Baizhi encountered that piece of Remnant band for the first time.\n\nDuring that time, Baizhi's passion for research was at its peak. No longer isolated in her studies, she delved into every aspect of civilization with the rest of the scientific expedition team.\n\nAs she ventured out into the frigid environment, she came to realize that true cold cannot be defined by a simple temperature reading of \"-25°C.\" It was more accurately painted by endless blankets of white snow, the shivers that still crept through insulated gear, and the desperate knocking of frozen instruments. This theory was merely a skeleton, in need of real feelings and experiences for true understanding. Baizhi dutifully accompanied her team to other sites, not just ordinary ruins but surreal places filled with Remnant energy—pure and complete information that remained elusive and intangible. Despite their advanced technology, they could not capture or analyze this powerful force.\n\nBaizhi's ninth Sonoro Sphere expedition revealed a breakthrough. \n\nThe buildings within were neither distorted nor a reflection of reality; their material remained unknown. \n\nFrom above, light flowed through a hole in the dome, casting a soft pearl shimmer upon them. Baizhi and her team's arrival seemed to have triggered a mechanism. The geometrical buildings, originally suspended, began to change in their arrangement rapidly, forming unique images of symbols and numbers.\n\nBaizhi was unable to decipher the purpose of the Sonoro Sphere or determine if she was witnessing a glimpse of the past, present, or an unknown future. But there was no time for wonder as her research instincts kicked in, pushing her to record every detail. This could be a breakthrough for a new theory—\n\nThe survey instruments displayed live fluctuation of frequencies. Baizhi cut off all distractions and focused on the displays. Her cumulated theories and feelings all came in handy for this exact moment.\n\nThe shorter the distance, the lower the energy consumption. Two points form a straight line, which leads to the source.\n\nJust like constructing a device channel, Baizhi selected the two ends of the extension, connected them into a line, and picked up the sampling device towards the center of the gathering—\n\nThe surging light responded to Baizhi's actions, condensing into a ball of pure white light.\n\nThe Remnant band was thus captured and manifested, full but like an empty shell, pure and free of impurities.\n\nLittle did Baizhi know back then, it would forever stay with her and shape her lifelong research."

This action does not even have a clear object. Once you make a wish, will it be answered? Who will answer it?\" Faced with Baizhi's sincere questions, her teammates were once again left speechless. Fortunately, after knowing her for a thousand days, they understood her seriousness and indirect tone as a means of seeking the truth and avoiding inconsistencies when judging or stating things.\n\nThough Baizhi never made a wish herself, she always stood beside her teammates, as they made wishes on candlelights, shooting stars, or anything else.\n\nThough confused, she still tried to understand them and be there for them, like what they did for her.\n\n\"Please, I hope we can completely unravel the mysteries of Remnant Creatures!\"\n\n\"It can be done, but unlikely within our generation.\"\n\n\"Ahh, it's true... yet disheartening nonetheless! No need to overthink it, making wishes and reality are two different things... Anyway, you'll understand when you have one!\"\n\nIn the dead silence of the icy field, that fateful day arrived. \n\nThe world collapsed without warning, as it often does. Vivid figures were dismantled by Tacet Discords, and eyes that once spoke of the future grew cold. Baizhi felt her pulse weaken and her thoughts spiral out of control. Why was this happening? So much had been lost in the search for the Sonoro Sphere. This couldn't be how it ends... She couldn't imagine a future without them.\n\n\"Please... I hope they can wake up again.\"\n\nShe finally made a wish of her own, but she didn't know who could grant it.\n\nAs the Sonoro Sphere collapsed, Tacet Discords swarmed towards her. A tumultuous mix of emotions churned inside her, unable to stop her burning desire for everyone to wake up and return to her. She longed for them to open their eyes like they used to...\n\nAt that moment, a Tacet Mark appeared on her body, and a Remnant Creature resembling an Epiphyllum appeared before her as if responding to her wish.\n\nNowadays, Baizhi still doesn't make wishes.\n\nWishes are not facts. She focuses on the tangible and what she can control instead. \n\nAs for the sole wish she has ever made, it was like a number infinitely close to zero, a longing buried deep inside her. It seems unattainable, yet it never fades away."

        "content": "Everything that happened under the glacier is already in the past.\n\nAs the only survivor, Baizhi never mentions it on her own accord.\n\nDespite attempts by nosy individuals to uncover her secrets, nothing was revealed. There was no shady secret that could not be revealed. Everyone did their best. The public could not assign blame, and even the most diligent researchers understood the inherent risks in scientific expeditions. They push themselves to the limit, sacrificing their bodies to discover the truth, while also recognizing death as a possible outcome.\n\nBaizhi's silence is rather more of her not knowing how to convey her thoughts.\n\nReflecting on the past is futile. Baizhi prioritized her time on crucial tasks, unique to her as the only survivor.\n\nSoon after joining the Academy, Baizhi was seen rushing between various labs in the Branch of Remnant Ecoacoustics, making countless innovations in the fields of Waveband Analysis, Applied Echo Studies, and simulated Sonoro Spheres.\n\nShe proposed that Remnant creatures are energy bodies derived from \"empty shells.\" They may be able to resonate with humans and be formed in a form beyond the band. By mastering the principle, humans may be able to develop artificial Sonoro Spheres and more Remnant creatures. These hypotheses shocked the academic community, but the Remnant creature that returned from a Sonoro Sphere with her perfectly proved her point.\n\nShe dubbed the Remnant creature You’tan after the udumbara, a mystical flower sometimes associated with the Epiphyllum. This night-blooming flower, like the elusive Dharma and ultimate truth, vanishes quickly after a brief blossom. Despite years of searching, researchers have only found glimpses of what they seek—a concept no more tangible than the ephemeral Epiphyllum blossom.\n\nPerhaps the name was a tribute to her lost comrades, or a constant reminder to keep pushing forward in her quest. So many answers await, and Baizhi knows she must find them all.\n\nBut she doesn't rush, for the destination lies ahead. She takes each step with patience as she journeys on before time runs out.\n\nAnd this is not a lonely journey, for Baizhi has found a partner along the way—someone who shares her path and purpose.\n\nOn the outskirts of Huanglong, Baizhi met the \"honored guest\" for the first time. Though she did not know where they came from, the moment Baizhi witnessed them absorbing the \"sound\" of an Echo, that tiny crackling of a sphere rang in her ears again.\n\nLook, she thought. The \"unknown now, but could be made known\" endpoint... It is within human's reach indeed."

To her, they are the embodiment of her past team's efforts and a poignant reminder of her teammates and mentors who sacrificed themselves deep in the icebound plain.

The result is a complex model consisting of 205 components. It's said that Baizhi can assemble it flawlessly, even with her eyes closed.

The cause of her Awakening remains unconfirmed.\n\nEncore bears a Tacet Mark on her upper back, and Post-Awakening examinations have revealed minor physical mutations, including wool-like hair tips. In times of heightened emotional states, she may also manifest sheep-like horns, requiring caution from testing personnel.\n\nAnalysis of test samples has revealed a non-convergent Rabelle's Curve with a noticeable periodic waveform, which classifies Encore as a Congenital Resonator.",

        "content": "Encore can't quite remember how long Cosmos and Cloudy have been part of her life. It feels as if they have always been there, intertwined with her existence from the very beginning. Perhaps she met them when she was too young to remember? Anyway, her first vivid memories of these Woolies trace back to a cramped yet lively theater.\n \nBack then, a captivating play unfolded amidst enthusiastic applause and the cheers of children. Kids around her age passionately called out the hero's name, but the stage was dimly lit with tightly closed curtains. After a brief confusion, the children regained their rhythm, chanting in unison for an encore until drums sounded, and the curtains lifted, welcoming the return of the hero.\n \nHer mother—more precisely, the Wooly knight \"portrayed\" by her mother—graced the stage, wielding a long sword that sent the villain fleeing in defeat. The black Wooly saved the white Wooly princess, and then they had a happy ever after.\n \nFor a long time, Encore associated her mother with the black Wooly knight. This brave protector of the kingdom reminded her of how her mother took care of her. Sometimes, when Encore acted up, she saw the same faked stern expression in both her mother and the Wooly knight.\n \nAs a child, Encore secretly favored the cute Cloudy, a detail she never shared with Cosmos.\n \nCloudy represented a gentle princess with a kind heart, adorned in beautiful dresses and a crown, residing in a dreamlike castle. The young Encore aspired to be a princess, longing for elegant dresses, a majestic crown, and a sumptuous bed to rest on. Free-spirited children like her didn't fret over monsters beyond the castle; it was the black Wooly's duty to keep her safe — outside the castle was the knight's battlefield.\n \nDuring those days, Cosmos and Cloudy were mere plushies. They were Encore's good friends, but after playtime, they would always maintain a quiet distance, lying still in a box without uttering a word. It was only when the night fell that faint whispers would emerge beside Encore's bed.\n \nTheir fluffy little hands would tenderly stroke Encore's cheeks, offering comfort and freeing her from the clutches of nightmares.\n \nDon't be afraid, Encore; sweet dreams await you. Sleep well, for the adventures with the Woolies will be carefully preserved in dreams."

        "title": "A Heroine's Return",
        "content": "The first time Cosmos and Cloudy spoke to Encore was at her mother's funeral. It was sudden; she still vividly remembers hearing them, as dirty soil and wilted leaves fell onto the coffin.\n\nInitially, the plushies were nestled quietly in Encore's arms, like how they always lay inside the box her mother carried for performances. However, as the funeral attendees began shoveling soil onto the coffin, Cloudy emitted an almost inaudible breath. The small episode went unnoticed by everyone except Encore.\n\n\"Encore, Encore...\" the plushies gradually upped their volume when they realized no one else was paying attention. Encore glanced around warily, trying to confirm no one else heard their voices.\n\n\"Let's go, Encore. I'm sooo bored,\" Cosmos bluntly complained. Surprisingly, its voice resembled Encore’s more than her mother's.\n\n\"But... but Cloudy doesn't want to leave...\" Cloudy whimpered. Encore struggled to discern who it sounded like—sometimes like herself, and sometimes more like her mother.\n\nThen, a brief silence followed. The cold morning wind howled through the cemetery, across the mourning crowd, carrying the sound of soil falling onto the coffin further away.\n\n\"No!\" Cosmos impatiently urged, \"We can't wait anymore! The show's almost over!\"\n\nAs if it suddenly remembered something, Cloudy became anxious, \"Encore, Encore! Go to the theater! Let's go to the theater!\"\n\nGazing into the distance, beyond the shadowy trees of the cemetery, Encore fixated on the theater\"s worn but still eye-catching sign. She heard the laughter of children—their uninhibited joy contrasting with the somber sounds of gravel and dirt.\n\nAmidst disapproving stares of her relatives, Encore fled the cemetery and arrived at the abandoned theater. As she pushed open the door, dusty silence was disturbed. Warm spotlights glimmered on the stage, revealing a sea of flowers.\n\nAmid the flowers, her mother's once withered figure now shone brilliantly, igniting Encore's longing for the woman she loved so dearly.\n\n\"Mommy...\" tears shimmered in Encore's eyes as she stumbled toward the stage. But right before she could touch her mother, she was forcefully pulled into darkness.\n\nThe show was over. The lights dimmed, and the curtains closed tightly. An eerie silence filled the theater, as the demons of sadness and fear crept in. Encore was trapped once again in her haunting nightmare.\n\n\"Encore!\" Cosmos shouted.\n\n\"Encore!\" Cloudy echoed.\n\nTo dispel Encore's fear and help her regain courage, Cosmos and Cloudy continued to shout the very word that could bring back the show: \"ENCORE.\" They kept trying until Encore regained her senses and joined them in shouting her own name.\n\nMoments later, the curtains lifted once more, accompanied by drum rolls. As the lights dispelled the darkness, Encore emerged onto the stage as the new leading role, welcomed by enthusiastic applause from Cosmos and Cloudy.\n\nOverwhelmed, Encore couldn't help but burst into tears. All the sadness and fear were washed away with her streaming tears. Soon, her usual smile reappeared on her face. Now, it was Encore’s turn to play the brave Wooly knight. A new adventure was about to unfold.\n\nThis time, she'll make sure her story has a happy ending."

        "title": "Orphanage and Candy House",
        "content": "Being the great Consultant of the Black Shores as she is now, Encore still refuses to act like a grown-up girl. To her, growing up means bidding farewell to bedtime stories, a prospect she firmly rejects. The very idea of drifting into sleep with empty, dark dreams instead of the vibrant hues of wonderful tales doesn’t sit well with her.\n\nLuckily, the adults in the Black Shores are happy to indulge her. However, there lies a challenge—who among the busy grown-ups can spare the time to read Encore a brief bedtime story? That's when Cloudy raises its little fluffy hand, promptly followed by the dark, fluffy hand of Cosmos.\n\nOn this particular evening, Cloudy brought Encore the old story of the Candy House.\n\n\"Then... then...\" Cloudy's voice trailed off, growing softer. Oh no, it seemed to have forgotten the next part. Nervously, Cloudy glanced at its companion, lifting the blanket and attempting to hide itself from the intense embarrassment.\n\n\"I know! I know!\" Cosmos eagerly pushed Cloudy aside, standing beside Encore's bed, proudly taking over the storytelling. \"Then, The Great Encore, blessed by blazing flames, defeated the big bad cat! Its dirty fur was all burnt!\"\n\n\"And what about the Great Encore's friends?\"\n\n\"Everyone was safe because of the Great Encore, of course. From then on, people lived in happiness without worrying about the big bad cat!\"\n\nEncore immersed herself in the story until her eyelids succumbed to the irresistible call of sleep. She wanted to add that \"Director Mama is NOT a big bad cat,\" but she was too tired to form a complete sentence. In the end, Cloudy and Cosmos, confused by Encore’s muttered objection, joined her under the soft covers, and they all drifted into a deep sleep.\n\nIn her dream, Encore found herself back at the orphanage, standing before the Candy House devoured by scorching flames.\n\nThe roof melted in the inferno, and boiling syrup oozed onto the dying black cat, adding to its suffering. The creature was a grotesque symbol of its own transgressions. Encore witnessed its demise, the inevitable consequence of its wicked deeds.\n\nHowever, the Reaper refused to easily forgive this sinful soul soaked in innocent blood, choosing instead to torture it and revel in its reluctant confession.\n\nAgonizing screams reverberated through the forest. All creatures, once aggressive hyenas and arrogant crows, cowered in fear. In this silent place, only Encore and the dying souls endured.\n\n\"It must hurt a lot...\" A fiery blaze cast a glow on Encore's face as she approached the dying cat. She gently pressed her cheek against its body, using her scarred little hands to stroke its fur.\n\nThe giant cat resented Encore for foiling its plan, expecting her to feel the same. After all, its evil deeds were cruel enough to earn the resentment of everyone. But why? Why did it feel nothing but warmth and sorrow from Encore's little hand?\n\nFrenzied flames danced around the Candy House, seemingly intent on devouring everything. Yet, Encore was not afraid. She leaned against the giant cat and started singing a lullaby.\n\nIt's a melody the cat had heard when it was still called \"Director Mama\" by Encore and other children in the orphanage. It had sung this same song countless times for every one of its children.\n\nEncore kept on singing, her voice becoming hoarse, until the blazing flames went out, until the first morning glow graced the sky. She felt the warm sunlight on her fingertips, and the cat's \"blessing\" faded away, disappearing into the misty depths of the forest.\n\nLooking down, the once huge, ugly cat had transformed into a small kitten, curling up in Encore's arms, sleeping soundly.\n\n\"Director Mama isn't a big bad cat!\" Encore's sleep talk startled the night patroller passing by. \"Encore has defeated the bad guys, so Mama no longer needs to be the big bad cat now!\" The night patrol shook her head in resignation, amused by the girl's unruly sleeping posture. She gently tucked Encore in and continued her patrol."

The sight of someone donning sunglasses indoors intrigued her, but wearing them in a dimly lit place also struck her as peculiar. Encore couldn't quite figure out the reasoning behind it.\n\nUpon noticing the nurse guiding this weird grown-up inside, Encore hastily returned to her bed, pretending to read her storybook.\n\n\"So... you're that kid from the news? The one from the orphanage...\" Aalto removed his sunglasses, scrutinizing Encore with care. The idea of such a small child achieving all THAT seemed impossible to him. He recalled the headline he had glimpsed in the newspaper—\"Nine-Year-Old Girl Cracks Sensational Case.\" While uncertain about the reliability of tabloid content, he had a mission here. Well, even THAT ONE said, \"This is the decision of Tethys.\" And the Tethys System could never go wrong.\n\n\"What a strange uncle you are. Encore doesn't know what you're talking about.\" Setting aside her storybook, Encore studied Aalto, mirroring his earlier scrutiny. To her, Aalto looked like a big dog, or maybe a wolf—an affable gray wolf that wouldn't bare its fangs at her.\n\n\"Oh yeah, you are Encore. That's right. You're the one I'm looking for. Wait! How could you call me an uncle? Take a closer look. Do I look that old?\" Aalto's distressed expression only made Encore laugh. Perhaps a bit bored from her hospital stay, she decided to make fun of this weird grown-up a little more.\n\n\"Okay, let Encore take a closer look... Yup! You’re still a big old guy! An uncle!\"\n\nAalto sighed in exasperation. \"Aww...\" He continued, \"C'mon, say something nice. This is no easy task, you know? I've got to take care of the other little ones from that orphanage, too.\" He pleaded, knowing that being teased by a child was insignificant compared to fulfilling his duties for the Black Shores.\n\n\"Anyway, back to the point. Little one, are you coming with me?\" Aalto's tone shifted from lighthearted to serious, but soon reverted to his usual playfulness, \"You can have as many candies as you want. Well... not too many, though. It’s bad for your teeth.\"\n\n\"That sounds suspicious,\" Encore replied, her bright eyes blinking with curiosity. Rather than answering Aalto's question, she picked up Cosmos and Cloudy, bringing them close to her ears. \"Woolies? You got something to tell me? Hmm... Wow, really? So this weird uncle is actually a good guy? No way!\"\n\n\"Hey, I'll forgive you for calling me an uncle now, but what's with the 'No way'? Do I not look like the perfect good guy?\"\n\n\"Since Cosmos and Cloudy said you're a good guy, Encore will go with you,\" she said, trying to make her tone sound formal, \"but Cosmos and Cloudy are coming too. They are my best friends.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Aalto agreed without hesitation. Those are just some ordinary plushies, aren't they? Aalto studied the plushies before him, trying to understand a child's perspective. It felt strange to him, but Encore seemed to truly believe that they were alive.\n\nIt was an adventure, a new adventure! Encore embraced her Woolie companions with joy, spinning first with Cosmos and then with Cloudy. As she grew older, she learned to treat all her friends with equal love and care.\n\nSuddenly, a crucial question struck Encore. \"What are we going to do?\"\n\n\"Well...\" Aalto donned his sunglasses once again, replying, \"To save the world, of course!\""

Notably, during Resonator Danjin's Awakening event, she exhibited an uncontrollable state of emotional outburst. It is speculated that overwhelming emotions may have catalyzed her awakening.\n\nA Tacet Mark is located on Danjin's upper left arm. Observations have revealed distinct alterations in her physical characteristics after her Awakening. A noteworthy alteration is the reddening of her pupils after exerting her Forte to a certain threshold.\n\nResonator Danjin's frequency fluctuations are stronger than usual, displaying uncommon instantaneous changes that may result in physical damage to her surroundings and any living beings therein when left unhandled.\n\nEmpirical testing has revealed that Danjin's destructive potential surpasses normal people by 78.94%.\nResonance Spectrum Pattern of this Resonator matches that of the human blood. Tests reveal strong Syntony Responses, yet the cause of Danjin's Awakening remains unclear.\n\n\nAnalysis of test samples has revealed a non-convergent Rabelle's Curve with a steep rise in its middle section. Therefore, Danjin is classified as a Mutant Resonator.",
      "certification": "Resonator Danjin's waveform graph shows zigzag fluctuations. The pattern of Time Domain is irregular. Both the upper and lower peak values are high and manifest proximity to the Criticality level. The waveform displays segments of partial fuzziness and abnormal waveform can be seen.\n\nResonant Criticality: Low, with low stability. Risk of Overclocking remains.\n\nResonator Danjin has no recorded history of Overclocking. However, during her first Awakening, she was on the verge of reaching her Resonant Criticality. This caused her blood to exhibit an explosive state and a highly sensitive Frequency Fluctuation reaction. Danjin lost control of her behavior, resulting in the spilling of part of her Frequency Energy. No casualties were reported, but the incident was classified as a Class 2 hazard (code EX61453).\n\nDiagnostic analysis reveals that her frequency fluctuation stemmed from a huge provocation in a short time. Noticeable aftereffect persists. As a result, there is still a small chance for Resonator Danjin to enter a state of fury during violent mood swings.\n\nFurther assessment reveals that the risk of Overclocking for Danjin is closely linked to her emotional state, posing a high risk. It is recommended to closely monitor her psychological and physical condition, and conduct routine counseling and examinations."

Even on those rare occasions when they have to pass through these places, they do so carefully and try their best to hide themselves.\n\nHowever, there was one girl who didn't follow this unspoken rule. The girl, clothed in vivid red, strolled through dangerous streets with an air of ease. The bright jade pendant she wore danced to the tune of her light footsteps.\n\nNaturally, this alluring appearance made her a prime target for predators.\n\nA bandit approached her under the guise of offering help, and asked why she was wandering alone in this desolate and treacherous place.\n\n\"I'm looking for someone,\" the girl answered.\n\n\"Wow, small world! I hardly see anyone around here. Funny enough, I actually saved someone recently and they're at my place. Maybe it's the person you're looking for? Want me to take you there?\" The bandit eagerly offered.\n\nThe girl studied him thoughtfully, pondering for a moment before finally giving a timid nod. \n\nPleased with this response, the bandit immediately led the girl to his camp.\n\nThey veered off the main roads and soon found themselves in a desolate place, shrouded in dense fog and overgrown with vegetation. Eerie cries echoed from the depths of the forest — was it a child's wail or a cat's scream? No one knew the answer. \n\nThe bandit, stealing a glance at the girl, worried that his prey may be scared off by the bloodcurdling ambiance.\n\nHowever, she still wore a calm expression with no trace of fear on her beautiful face.\n\n\"Stupid chick,\" the bandit snickered to himself.\n\nAs they approached an old iron door at the end of the path, intermittent whimpers could be heard from behind it. The girl pushed the door open and inside, they found a trembling and battered little girl.\n\n\"Is this the one you're looking for?\" asked several bandits with wicked grins, surrounding the girl.\n\n\"Exactly!\" replied the girl with a bright smile.\n\nAmidst deafening screams and agonized moans, crimson blood splattered everywhere... And so began a brutal slaughter that hushed even the evening glow."

Her request, however, was rather unusual: she asked him to repair a broken sword.\n\n“What happened to it?” Uncle Wei furrowed his brow and inquired. He was no stranger to repairing all kinds of damaged weapons; still, he couldn’t help but wonder what could have caused such significant wear on this blade.\n\nIn his mind’s eye, Uncle Wei conjured up an image of a formidable big man wielding the sword with immense power, slashing through whatever stood in his way without mercy. By no means could he relate this image to a slender girl like her.\n\n“Sorry, I may have hit them a bit too hard... I didn’t mean it...” the girl answered, her embarrassment evident. “Is it difficult to repair?”\n\nUncle Wei stared at her in disbelief. He examined the rolled edge with his callused finger and replied, “...No worries. I’ll give it a go.”\n\nWith precision and skill, Uncle Wei heated the blade until it glowed and struck it forcefully with his hammer. Sparks flew, but the blade remained unyielding. Years of expertise guided him as he inspected and stroked the damaged metal, contemplating each blow. In a moment of clarity, he discovered the problem.\n\n“The blade is exceptionally hard but lacks toughness. Its center of mass is off now, and it has a special frequency. It’s difficult to repair and sharpen with traditional tools.”\n\n“If you wanna get it repaired,” Uncle Wei continued, “you’ll need some really hard gray chalks with a good amount of Tacetite. But they’re not easy to get, only found in a dangerous place, with a lot of rock cliffs! Don’t get your hopes up, kid.”\n\n“You mean the Desorock Highland, right? Please give me some time. I’ll be back soon.”\n\nWith those words, the girl dashed out like the wind, leaving Uncle Wei confused and the rolled blade forgotten. \n\nShe returned shortly after, carrying a big piece of gray chalk with ease. \n\n“Is this enough?” she asked, surprising Uncle Wei with her quick return from the dangerous Desorock Highland. \n\n“Absolutely!” he stammered, amazed at her speed. How did she make it back so quickly?\n\nThe girl smiled, and cute dimples appeared on her face — a faint red spot could be vaguely seen on one of her dimples. Was it a mole? Or was it... something else?"

It's a symphony of clanging pots and sweet smelling syrup. That's when Danjin shows up, handing over a neat stack of Shell Credits for her favorite snack: two pieces of Loong Whisker Crisps. She always puts one in her pocket first, and then eagerly breaks apart the other, savoring each piece like it's a precious gem.\n\nA food vendor lady noticed Danjin always came alone and couldn't help but feel sorry for her: Even the cheapest snacks in Jinzhou, like Loong Whiskers Crisps, seemed so precious to this girl. Wanting to spread some kindness, the lady started giving Danjin extra snacks popular with girls her age — from pretty Rock Sugar to fluffy Dreamy Floss, and more. At first, Danjin would always refuse, because she felt uncomfortable accepting someone's generosity without a good reason, and because her wallet was running on empty from constantly repairing her weapons.\n\nHowever, the lady insisted it wouldn't be trouble to let Danjin have some more sweets for free, as she always prepared extra snacks for her sweets-loving younger sister back home, who was approximately Danjin's age. Touched by this genuine kindness, Danjin eventually nodded and accepted the extra snacks.\n\nFrom that day on, every time the vendor lady gave Danjin extra snacks, a mysterious gift appeared on her stall. Rock sugar brought a Pearl Leaf, while Dreamy Floss resulted in a Caltrop. These herbs were crucial in easing her younger sister's panic disorder, which she hadn't even told Danjin about.\n\nMaybe sooner or later, her younger sister would be able to leave the house by herself, and enjoy the freshly made Loong Whiskers Crisps with Danjin."

Years ago, they slaughtered Danjin’s entire family. Her younger sister, a girl with a kind soul, opened the door for them out of sympathy, only to welcome the bloodthirsty blades that claimed her family’s lives.\n\nThe culprits already met the wrath of Danjin’s sword, but even after many years, similar tragedies continued to occur. The evil persisted. It seemed like an impenetrable barrier, preventing anyone from escaping their grasp. Day after day, month after month, new tragedies emerged as other evildoers continued their reign of terror. Danjin knew she had to find the root and eradicate it once and for all to stop the cycle of pain and suffering inflicted upon the innocent. She would not rest until justice was served and peace was restored.\n\nDanjin decided to make herself the bait. She travelled through treacherous terrain looking all innocent and defenseless, wiping out one hideout after another while hunting for more clues.\n\nHidden throughout the wilderness were these camps, blending into the natural surroundings. With precision and thoroughness, she scoured every inch of each campsite, uncovering vital details amidst the blood-stained haystacks and dilapidated structures. \n\nHer efforts paid off when she discovered that all the camp vehicles had passed through a specific location: where the bandits had been ambushing innocent victims.\n\nHiding in the tall weeds, Danjin nibbled on a Loong Whiskers Crisp, her eyes glued to the foggy crossroad. \n\nFor seven days she had been waiting at this crossroad, stopping any suspicious vehicles that passed by. She refused to give up hope of catching those bandits, no matter what.\n\nFinally, eerie headlights and crunching wheels broke through the dense fog. The wheels’ creaking almost drowned out a faint whimper, but it didn’t escape Danjin’s ears.\n\nEmerging from her hiding place, Danjin approached the vehicle. \n\nShe recited the lines she prepared with a perfectly practiced timid voice: “Excuse me... I’m lost. Could you please give me a ride?”"

After escorting the children to the Patrol Station, Danjin sighed in relief and decided to return to the city for some much-needed rest.\n\nShe strolled down the decorated street illuminated by vibrant festival lanterns and warm lights. The moon shone brightly above, adding to the enchanting atmosphere of the night.\n\nMany years ago, on a similar moonlit night, her family shared precious moments together. Her mother had prepared a table full of mouth-watering dishes, whereas Danjin’s younger sister happily presented two pieces of Loong Whiskers Crisp, one for herself, and one for Danjin.\n\n“B-Big sister, this is for you...”\n\nHer reminiscing was interrupted by a small voice. A younger girl held out a piece of Loong Whiskers Crisp, speaking to Danjin timidly. The treat was sprinkled with Dreamy Floss and colorful candies that fitted the festive vibe perfectly. The vendor lady, wearing a warm smile, gestured for Danjin to take it.\n\nDanjin’s legs took her closer to the stall, and it seems there is a new face working at the stall today.\n\n“Thanks to your herbs, Xinxin can leave our house now. Since it’s been safer recently, I decided to take her out to get some fresh air.”\n\n“It’s the first time she ever dared to talk to a stranger since her recovery. Maybe this is the blessing of fate?”\n\nIndeed, Danjin thought to herself. This little girl named Xinxin was one of the children she had rescued during one of her raids. The girl seemed to recognize Danjin, too. She took off a lantern decorating the stall and shoved it into Danjin’s hand.\n\n“C-can we... set it off together?”\n\nDanjin nodded, and the three of them set off the lantern into the night sky. The lantern soared, carrying their wishes along with it, joining the thousands of other floating lights in the velvety night."

      "doc": "Evaluation Basis: [Resonance Assessment 1617-G]\n\nAccording to Resonator Aalto's reports, there was a rare occurrence of heavy fog on the day of his birth. Aalto's Tacet Mark is located on the left side of his neck. Other than gaining the ability to briefly transform into a mist-like form, no significant physical changes have been observed in Aalto's body after his Awakening.\n\nResonator Aalto excels in the art of camouflage and transformation, often assuming an elusive and fluctuating physical state, akin to the characteristics of mist. Further tests conducted to ascertain the properties of the mist he conjures yielded inconclusive results.\n\nThe Resonance Spectrum Pattern of Aalto matches our known Spectrum Patterns of fog. Strong Syntony Reactions have been observed during testing, confirming the connection between fog and Aalto's Awakening. \nAdditionally, analysis of test samples has revealed a non-convergent Rabelle's Curve with a noticeable periodic waveform, which classifies Aalto as a Congenital Resonator.\n\n\nResearcher's Annotation: As stated in the report, this Resonator is cunning and a master of disguises, thus rendering the credibility of his recounts questionable.\n\nAnnotation to the annotation: As a broker honoring integrity. I, Aalto, solemnly swear that the recount I presented is 100% truth. Nothing more, nothing less.",
      "certification": "Resonator Aalto's waveform graph shows stable elliptical fluctuations in the Time Domain with no abnormal patterns. Upon examination, all results fall within normal parameters.\n\nIn terms of Resonant Criticality, Resonator Aalto ranks at a moderate level with high stability, resulting in a low risk of Overclocking. \n\nResonator Aalto disappeared halfway through the Overclock diagnosis, thus no Overclock history records were obtained."

        "content": "A bad deal.\n\nOr so it seemed.\n\nOne day, Aalto became known for the intel he had on some ancient treasure. From naughty children to old men in their sixties, many wanted to buy that intel from him, but he politely turned down every offer. \n\n“Hey, little one. Better not spend your allowance on this. Let’s get you home.”\n\n“Sorry, gramps. I don’t accept retirement funds.” \n\nThese people all assumed they didn’t offer enough to pique Aalto’s interest, but actually, he was simply waiting for the right buyer. \n\nThen, one day, that very buyer finally appeared, cloaked in layers. The man struck the deal with Aalto at a shockingly low price. Others were baffled by Aalto’s willingness to accept such a bad offer. \n\nDays later, an electronic display in the New Federation police department office broadcasted the latest news: the long-sought theft ring had finally been caught. \n\nA cloud of mist crept into the police chief’s office, obscuring the display.\n\n“Enough TV. It’s time to settle our deal.”\n\nThe chief slammed a folder of files onto the desk, along with a suitcase filled with Credits.\n\n“That’s quite a trick you pulled off back there. Tell me, Mr. Aalto, how were you so sure they’d take the bait? Touting valuable intel about the legendary treasure in broad daylight, weren’t you worried about catching their suspicion?”\n\n“Don’t underestimate cash-chasing gamblers. They’ll risk it all, even their lives. Profit is worth any danger to them.”\n\nThe police chief pushed the files and suitcase towards Aalto.\n\n“Here’s your payment, and the list of names you requested. Pleasure doing business.”\n\n“Same to you.” \n\nAalto opened the suitcase, took out a single piece of Shell Credit, and flipped it into the air. Before the Credit could touch the ground, he had already transformed into mist, vanishing from sight."

        "title": "A Fair Exchange",
        "content": "A fair exchange.\n\nUnder Aalto’s rules.\n\nAccording to Aalto, every customer is equal. Be it a high-ranking official, an aristocrat, a commoner on city streets, or an Exile shunned by society, they are no different. Aalto never categorizes his customers into ranks — no high and low; no rich and poor. Treating every customer equally has always been his unwavering principle.\n\nYet, there would always be those who try to test his limit.\n\n“Aalto, right? You’re comin’ with us.”\n\nAalto sensed the ill intention behind the visitor’s approach, but he put on a welcoming smile as usual.\n\n“Aww... Sorry, pal, but that’s a no-can-do. This customer right here was in line first.”\n\nSuddenly, the other client was shoved aside as the thugs barged in, causing chaos and panic in the crowded room. The other patrons all fled, fearful of injury.\n\nAalto quickly came to the victim’s aid, guiding them to safety with a gentle hand. With a calm demeanor, he righted a toppled chair and casually draped an arm around the agitated thug’s shoulder.\n\n“Listen, buddy, everything has its rules. I’ve got mine written down right here, see? ‘First come, first served. No pushing or shoving.’ What am I supposed to do with you breaking two rules in one go?” \n\nThe thug shook his arm off, “If our boss wants to see someone, he gets what he wants. That’s the rule we go by.”\n\nMist obscured the crowd as Aalto’s words ended. He swiftly incited chaos, causing the thugs to turn on each other in panic.\n\n“Oops, my bad. I forgot to mention another rule: ‘No hustling deals.’ Let your boss know not to break any rules next time. Can’t do business without them.”\n\nWith their tails tucked between their legs, the thugs fled, leaving Aalto to return to his usual welcoming smile. \n\n“Alrighty then! Let’s pick up where we left off. What was it you wanted to inquire about again, good sir?”"

The two are almost inseparable, and their presence brings a burst of noise wherever they go.\n\nOutside a heavily guarded building, a man in sunglasses leaned casually against the wall, while the little girl next to him used her hands as binoculars to scan the area.\n\n“See the target? The one we’re after.”\n\n“Yuppers! Target sighted. Encore will get it done real quick, as long as Aalto doesn’t drag behind me!” \n\n“Aw. Encore, you broke my heart. My plan is flawle—”\n\nBefore he could finish, Encore had already dashed out with Cloudy and Cosmos, leaving Aalto’s words hanging in the air.\n\nIn the distance, Aalto could see Encore talking to the guard, making big gestures in the air, and occasionally pointing at him. \n\nWhen Aalto got there, the guard let him in and patted his shoulder. He looked sympathetic.\n\n“Buddy, must be hard raising your daughter alone all these years.” \n\nAalto simply nodded along in silent camaraderie. He took Encore inside the building without encountering any problems. \n\n“Why do people always believe your stories, Aalto? They all sound so fake!”\n\n“You see, my stories are tailor-made for each situation.”\n\n“What’s that supposed to mean?”\n\n“He’s a single dad. He’d find that heartbreaking family tale you told super relatable. Also, what do you mean my stories are fake? “\n\nCloudy and Cosmos jumped onto Encore’s shoulders and sang a chorus of “Baa, baa baa.”\n\n“Look! The Woolies think they sound super fake, too.” \n\n“Well, fake or not, they got the job done just fine. Alright, here comes the real deal. Time to bring out your A game.”\n\n“Woolies Adventure time. Let’s do this!”"

And so, his potential customers always come with a hefty sum of money prepared.\n\nHowever, his desired payments can sometimes be unpredictable and bizarre — ranging from a black pearl to a cloud in the sky or even a piece of music.\n\nSome may throw a tantrum over the seemingly ridiculous request, but Aalto would simply show them the door with a polite smile.\n\n“My dear customer, ever heard of the saying ‘amiability makes you rich’? You really need to mind your language. Besides, it’s just business, not charity. If you can’t be bothered with the payment, then I’m afraid we’ll just have to do business at another time.” \n\nOnce, a ragged little boy paced back and forth of Aalto’s door for several days.\n\n“Howdy, little man, what’s with the long face? Let me guess. Lost your puppy?”\n\n“Wow! You really know everything! So, do you know where Pebbles went?”\n\n“You know, there’s no such thing as a free lunch. You want my help, then you’ll have to pay up.”\n\nThe boy shook his head, disappointed,\"But I don’t have anything on me.\"\n\n“Well, that’s rather unfortunate... Let’s see. How about you pay me after I find Pebbles for you?”\n\nAalto’s mist soon spread to every corner. Eventually, he found the lost puppy outside the city and safely brought it back.\n\nBeneath the twinkling night stars, a happy puppy ran to the little boy, wagging its tail in excitement. \n\nAs today’s story came to an end, Encore couldn’t help but ask, “I didn’t know you’d help people for free!”\n\nAalto responded with a smile, idly twirling a small marble in his hand. On its surface was a roughly carved smiley face, reminiscent of a young boy’s crafting."

Post-Awakening observations found some growths that resemble Loong scale on his left jaw. No indications of progressive expansion have been detected.\n\nResonator Jiyan possesses the ability to manipulate wind energy, which he can channel into a \"Qingloong\" that aids him in battle. Additionally, he possesses exceptional perception and leadership skills, utilizing his connection to the winds to gather and analyze battlefield information with astonishing accuracy. Empirical testing has shown an impressive accuracy rate of 99.12% in evaluating dynamic situations.\nJiyan's Resonance Spectrum Pattern shows no resemblance to known samples. The cause of his Awakening remains unknown.\n\nAnalysis of test samples has revealed a non-convergent Rabelle's Curve with a steep rise in its middle section. Resonator Jiyan is thereby classified as a Mutant Resonator.",

        "content": "Shortly after Jiyan's appointment as the Midnight Ranger's general, an unexpected Tacet Discord Outbreak occurred. It was during this battle that he suspected the Threnodian's resurrection.\n\nAs the weary soldiers recovered from a fierce battle on the frontline, they were greeted by an ominous sight: shadow ravens circling above and swarms of Tacet Discords charging towards their position at the Norfall Barrens and Desorock Highland pass. \n\nThe outnumbered army knew that failure to defend this stronghold could spell doom for the entire Huanglong.\n\nEven seasoned veterans had never faced a crisis as urgent as this one. Amidst the chaos, Jiyan alone remained composed.\n\n\"All of you. Prepare to fight.\"\n\n\"Absurd! If we lose now, it's truly over. We can still retreat and protect the city!\"\n\n\"Choose now: stand with courage, seize our chance. Or run and face defeat. For centuries, the Midnight Rangers have held this pass without retreat. Or do you prefer to go down in history as cowards?\"\n\nThe veterans left, their emotions ranging from disappointment to rage.\n\nJiyan's resolve remained unshaken. He carefully studied real-time images from monitoring devices and noticed a connection between the Tacet Discords and the shadow ravens above. Quickly summoning the other commanders in the military, Jiyan devised a plan and led their coordinated army to face the enemy head-on. With precision, they used Sound Emulators set in a narrow valley to emit the shadow raven's frequency. As he expected, the Tacet Discords were drawn towards the sound, allowing for their easy capture.\n\nMeanwhile, the Midnight Rangers stationed at Norfall Barrens were instructed to join hands with their comrades in the Desorock Highland, and carry out a pincer attack on the Tacet Discords. In the midst of a sandstorm, Jiyan bravely fought off hordes of enemies, paving the way for his fellow soldiers with unmatched strength.\n\nThe Tacet mark on Jiyan's nape was flickering, a sign of Forte overexertion, but he pressed on. His Qingloong flew high in the sky like a proud banner of resolution, never once faltering to the ground."

However, at some point, Jiyan became haunted by a recurring nightmare.\n\nIn that dream, the city of Jinzhou was engulfed in flames and consumed by Tacet Discords. The monsters raged on, feeding on the frequencies of the dead. Chaotic sounds echoed throughout the city, creating a symphony of destruction.\n\nOn the flame-lit battlefield, a lone figure fought relentlessly with a lance in hand. Each swing tore through the air. One, two, three... Hundreds of thousands of Tacet Discords fell under his fierce and restless strikes.\n\nDespite his best efforts, the man could not quell the endless swarm of Tacet Discords ravaging the land. Day after day, year after year, he fought in vain until he was the sole survivor on a desolate battlefield. The Tacet Discords transformed into his fallen comrades, encircling and closing in on him.\n\n\"That's a clueless kid! How can we trust him with our lives?\"\n\n\"You said you would protect us... but why?\"\n\n\"Jiyan, what on earth are you fighting for?\"\n\nDespite being known for his calm and decisive nature, few were aware of the nightmares that would sometimes jolt him awake, haunted by the voices of the dead.\n\nAs the general, it was Jiyan's duty to safeguard not only the borders, but also the entirety of his nation. Every move he made and every plan he enacted carried immense responsibility and consequence.\n\nThis is why he seems to be always frowning, thinking, and planning ahead. One day, perhaps, he will finally turn around and answer those questions from the dead.\n\nHe fights for the living, and for the deceased."

Just as a gentle rain quenches parched soil, this person carefully orchestrates aid and ensures that no area goes without assistance. \n\n\"Team 3's captain obviously had difficulties using his left leg during the drill.

They'll know what to do.\"\n\n\"Transfer some money to this account in the name of the General Affairs Department. Debit my account for the funding.\"\n\n\"I remember there has been a 20% increase in the number of recruits this year. Verify this with the Logistics.

        "content": "When asked about his childhood, Jiyan recalls a plethora of memories: the smell of medicine, the bright lights of the operating room, the sound of medical equipment clashing, and the hallway where many goodbyes were exchanged.\n\nBorn into a medical family, Jiyan became his mother's assistant at the age of 10. He excelled at medical skills and was popular among patients, not only for his expertise, but also for his great ability to soothe their upsets and cater to their needs.\n\nDespite his exceptional medical prowess, there were still some lives that Jiyan couldn't bring back from the jaws of death—the last patient he couldn't save was Beiwang, his friend and mentor, who was heavily injured by Tacet Discords. \n\nBeiwang was initially known to Jiyan as the latter's patient, among many other Midnight Rangers who had to visit a doctor after fighting the frequent Tacet Discord tides plaguing the land. \n\nBeiwang was impressed by Jiyan's intellect and intuition, leading him to share details of the Midnight Rangers' marches and provide military instruction. Conversely, Jiyan actively contributed his analytical skills to strategy discussions, despite never experiencing battle firsthand. His unique perspectives injected vitality into their conversations, invigorating Beiwang's perspectives with a fresh outlook.\n\nBeiwang's passing ignited a transformative spark in Jiyan—his wistfulness, frustration, and regret turned into his strength to wield the lance on the battlefield. \n\nJiyan began to realize that the Lament is such a deep-seated disease in the world's veins that not even the most sophisticated medical instrument or the most adept surgeon could remove it. This realization drove him to cure the world in another way—he took up arms and fought the Tacet Discords head-on, with unwavering resolve.\n\nNow, only the gourd-shaped pill case on his belt loop indicates that he was once a doctor. Speculations abound about the contents of the case, with some claiming he uses sugar pearls to comfort children and others saying he drinks from it after battles.\n\nIf someone asks Jiyan about it, he would answer frankly, \"Just some common medicines, in case someone needs them.\""

We've been training so hard for the Gulpuff Relay. So please...\"\n\n\"Yeah, please, Jiyan!\" they chorused, their urgency palpable.\n\nStanding at the center was a bright-eyed young man. Meeting their sincere gaze, he nodded in agreement. Therefore, a temporary team was formed.\n\nThe young man asked about each teammate's conditions and the relay order. Then, he decided to adjust the strategy and take on the anchor leg himself.\n\nThe Games, initially held to relieve the tension of Jinzhou people after their first triumph over the Tacet Discord Outbreaks, had evolved into a major event in Jinzhou, in which the Gulpuff Relay was one of the biggest highlights.\n\nThe whistle blew. The relay racers charged forward, skillfully evading obstacles as they piloted their Gulpuffs. Crowds of cheering audience lined the banks.\n\nHowever, a mistake occurred during the baton exchange between the first and second runners, leading the temporary team to lag far behind.\n\n\"Oops, looks like this team's hit a little snag! As a temporary team, their teamwork might be a bit rusty. Pity for them!\"\n\nThe commentator then shifted his attention to the top three contenders.\n\nAmidst the cheers, the race reached its climax as the final runner of the temporary team swiftly closed the gap with their opponents, unnoticed by everyone.\n\n\"Oh man! Look at the temporary team! There was a hiccup earlier, but now the last runner is overtaking! There's a key curve ahead... Wha-what's happening? He's overtaking everyone on the curve! That's absolutely amazing!\"\n\nUndisturbed by the noise and excitement of the audience, he kept his eyes locked on the finish line. A single thought was driving him forward—faster, just a little faster. His heart pounded, drowning out the loud cheers.\n\nAs confetti descended with a loud bang, the cacophony of sounds once again poured into his ears.\n\nThey won!\n\n\"Who could've imagined this temporary team would break the record! Congratulations to the young lads!\"\n\nHis teammates swarmed him in excitement, surrounding the young man. Raising the weighty trophy, they vowed to team up again for the next Games."

    "talent": {
      "name": "Dragon's Breath",
      "doc": "Evaluation Basis: [Resonance Assessment 2183-G]\n\nAccording to Resonator Mortefi's reports, indications of his Awakening began to manifest during his youth. His actual Awakening was accompanied by a surge of intense anger.\n\nMortefi's Tacet Mark is located on his right chest. When Mortefi's Forte is activated, crystalline matter in the shape of dragon scales materializes around his Tacet Mark. These scales burn intensely as he harnesses his power.\n\nResonator Mortefi demonstrates the ability to generate and manipulate fire through the focused concentration of heat. The intensity of the flames produced is closely linked to Mortefi's emotional state. Extensive experimentation has revealed that the fire is a tangible manifestation of Mortefi's accumulated negative emotions over a certain threshold.\n\nThe Resonance Spectrum Pattern of Mortefi has been observed to align closely with that of the Dragonkin, a species that is currently declared extinct. Due to the unavailability of living Dragonkin for Syntony tests, it is currently not possible to empirically confirm the cause of Mortefi's Awakening.\n\nAnalysis of test samples has revealed a non-convergent Rabelle's Curve, with a steep rise in its middle section. Resonator Mortefi is thereby classified as a Mutant Resonator.",
      "certification": "Resonator Mortefi's waveform graph shows zigzag fluctuations. The pattern of Time Domain is regular, though the peak values show an increasing tendency. Peak values are currently under Criticality level, and abnormal waveforms are not identified.\n\nResonant Criticality: High, combined with low stability. A high risk of Overclocking is present.\n\nResonator Mortefi has a documented history of Overclocking. Maximum recorded Overclock rating: Moderate.\n\nDuring Overclocking, the scale-shaped red crystalline matter on Mortefi's chest continuously expands to cover a larger area of his skin. This transformation is accompanied by a significant rise in body temperature, resulting in the manifestation of intense Frequency Fluctuation. Notably, a fiery apparition resembling a dragon becomes visible behind Mortefi during this stage.\n\nMortefi was the cause of a major fire in Desorock Highland. This event was classified under code EX67891 as a Class 3 hazard. Fortunately, no casualties were reported. Resonator Mortefi's Forte and Overclocking history indicate that negative emotions are his primary trigger for Overclocking, which warrants a higher risk of Overclocking. Therefore, it is recommended to closely monitor Resonator Mortefi's psychological status and implement regular counseling and examinations."

These details are enough to tell Mortefi's noble background.\n\nMortefi acknowledges that his family background played a role in shaping his personality, but it was not the only factor.\n\nA theory suggests that all music has already been composed, and it is the duty of musicians to discover these melodies. Similarly, scientists spend their lives trying to understand the melodies of the universe. Mortefi draws inspiration from the precise and harmonious nature of classical music for his research.\n\nHe loves sweet desserts, because after long hours of research he needs a quick energy fix to keep his brain functioning and mood pleasant.\n\nHis obsession with cleanliness stems from the need for a sterile lab, leading him to detest anyone who contaminates it.\n\nUltimately, it is his passion and dedication for scientific research that truly defines Mortefi's character.\n\nHowever, Mortefi's foreign identity still drew suspicion and rumors. Some claimed family connections secured his spot, others accused him of bribing officials.\n\nMortefi ultimately proved himself with his undeniable capabilities: The fact that he developed five Tacetite weapon prototypes in under three days was enough to shutdown most rumors."

        "content": "Despite his occasionally intimidating demeanor, Mortefi is not quick to lash out. \n\nInstead, he reserves his snarky tongue for moments of dire need, especially when colleagues encounter illogical and unreasonable clients. In these situations, Mortefi always makes sure they get a good taste of his linguistic arsenal.  Mortefi’s use of perplexing metaphors and literary allusions favored by the New Federation’s elites, along with the latest Huanglong slang, may leave one baffled. \n\nTo truly grasp the underlying messages in Mortefi’s scathing words, perhaps one must experience it themselves. But then again, some mysteries might be best left unsolved.  People have even compiled Mortefi’s sarcastic remarks into little handy notes, carrying them around as portable ammo for unjust situations where they can’t find the right words to fight back.  \n\nMortefi was momentarily speechless when he found out about this. He laughed, exasperated, “It’s not that they didn’t know what to say, but societal pressures and cultural norms kept them silent. As an outsider unbound by Huanglong’s conventions, it just so happens I could speak on their behalf without restraint.”  \n\nWith no social obligations or funding issues to worry about, indeed someone like Mortefi, a foreign man with an elite background, can attain such freedom.  \n\nOver time, this trait somehow gained Mortefi a considerable number of followers among a group of socially inept scientists.  After all, he really never hesitates to stand up for any stranger he just met."

        "content": "In the eyes of his colleagues, Mortefi's laboratory is an absolutely forbidden territory. However, to the children of Jinzhou, his lab is a promised wonderland.\n\nMortefi can turn any outrageous request into a reality with efficiency and reliability. Just provide a clear description and some sincere compliments to sweeten the deal, and your desired item will be in your hands before you know it.\n\nHe may appear reluctant when the kids pester him for a new toy, and he'd even half-jokingly remark on how they are \"so good at bossing me around\". But despite this, he is wholeheartedly dedicated to fulfilling their every request. He is willing to go without sleep for days to bring their ideas to life. Yet he is awkwardly unwilling to let the kids know the effort he puts into their entrusted tasks. Instead, he downplays his creations as simple works completed in a few hours.\n\nIn Jinzhou, Mortefi is the creative force behind 80% of popular children's toys and entertainment facilities. From the Spinning Bloop to the Swinging Loongboat and the Sabyrboar Scooter, his designs always captivate young minds. Surprisingly, he doesn't charge any patent fees for these designs. \n\nFor Mortefi, it's not about money; it's about seeing the joy, wonder, and admiration in children's eyes. \n\nOr perhaps, it's a way for him to recapture his own lost childhood.\n\nOn the other hand, many believed it to be a complete waste of his talent. Unfortunately, some people assumed that clear communication would be enough to control Mortefi, and some even tried to coerce him into service. But those who dared were met with clever inventions crafted solely to mock them. Witnesses claim these inventions were diabolical enough to torture like an interrogation, yet still fulfill the requested task. Those who got away swore never to get on Mortefi's bad side again in their lifetime.\n\nIf there was a department in Jinzhou for devising creative punishments for criminals, Mortefi would definitely excel as its leader."

But even this small act of rebellion soon lost its appeal as his parents simply replaced the destroyed items. New and shiny, they were always neatly arranged, a constant reminder of Mortefi's futile attempts at defiance.\n\nThe only moments of peace Mortefi could have was when he disassembled and rebuilt the mechanical objects. A unique form of communication between man and machine brought him much-needed tranquility: In these moments, he could trust without doubt, be himself without flattery, and no longer endure unwarranted anger. In the world of gears and cogs, there was no room for ambiguity. If a machine malfunctioned, he clould simply identify and tackle the problem one step at a time.\n\nMortefi's parents didn't scold him when they found out what he was doing; instead, they were proud. The cult of technology ran deep in the blood of every citizen in the New Federation, and his talent were recognized as a valuable asset.\n\nWith their support, Mortefi gained rare resources, top-notch mentorship and access to esteemed research events. He received endless acclaim and was hailed as the country's youngest scientific prodigy.\n\n...Until everything changed when he met a certain young man.\n\nEven to this day, Mortefi still vividly remembers that encounter at the New Federation's World Expo, when he was 17 years old.\n\nIt was a masterpiece, crafted from inexpensive materials yet possessing the stability of top-grade ones. The design's apparent simplicity warrants in-depth research, with numerous papers devoted to it. While being simple and affordable, it outshone all of Mortefi's inventions in terms of practicality and usability. It was a true innovation for humanity, a stroke of genius.\n\nMortefi stared at that young man in the crowd, who seemed to sense his gaze and looked back to meet his eyes. \n\nSurrounded by the deafening cheers and clamor, he only managed to memorize that young man's place of origin: Huanglong."

        "content": "Before Wutherology was formally established as a branch of modern science, Tacetite technology was once thought to be \"magic\".\n\nLittle is known about why Mortefi left the New Federation on the day of his coming-of-age ceremony, or what exactly he went through on his way to Huanglong... And now, he is fervently obsessed with the study of Tacetite.\n\n\"I have improved the Tacetite module in this turret, just a little bit. It is now capable of outputting at a hundred times the power. But be sure to follow these 100 operating rules...\"\n\n\"Wait, what will happen if I don't?\"\n\n\"The Tacetite energy will be enough to uproot this city and set it on a heavenly journey.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"Tsk. What is that look on your face? I am only responsible for getting you what you need and providing necessary explanations. It's up to you to decide how you'll use it.\"\n\nSimilar cases are in their dozens, ultimately putting Huaxu Academy on one of the Directors' special attention list at the Ministry of Development. This relentless drive has fueled the rapid advances in Wutherology, but it came at a cost. \n\nIn the end, even the other scholars at the academy began to worry about Mortefi, who often went several nights without sleep in pursuit of perfection. He worked tirelessly, but at this pace, he risked burning out too soon like a fire consuming itself.\n\nMortefi often remembered his tutor's reminder: always keep in mind what you are working for. Perhaps, he thought, I am just seeking joy in communicating with the machines.\n\nIf his fire were to someday burn out, he hoped to leave behind a legacy of knowledge for future generations. To make the flame burn even brighter as it lasted, further illuminating the path for those who would follow in his footsteps.\n\nWith the test results he had been waiting for finally came out, Mortefi closed his eyes and collapsed into his chair.\n\nPerhaps the real \"magic\" for the Academy lies in its devoted researchers, one such as Mortefi. Unconstrained by societal expectations, he works tirelessly to advance humanity's knowledge of the world.\n\n...That being said, there will presumably be more complaints for the newly appointed Director to handle."

        "content": "She awoke from her dream.\n\nThe sun broke over the horizon, casting a warm glow across the Black Shores. It was the dawn of another ordinary day. Camellya opened her eyes, stretching leisurely atop the treetops. Her movements were graceful, and a fall would be unthinkable. Even if she did slip, the vines would cradle her fall. She loved sleeping like this, away from any disturbance or people.\n\n\"What a beautiful morning,\" she mused. She felt stable, in mind and body, and the thought of needing the medical pod seemed distant. This was a good thing.\n\nShe knew {PlayerName} was to remain in the Black Shores, preparing for {Male=his;Female=her} journey to Rinascita. The prospect delighted her, for that meant more time to talk, laugh, and spend time together.\n\nShe gave {PlayerName} a gift, a bracelet designed to monitor frequencies, just like the one {Male=he;Female=she} had given her before.\n\nIt was the first gift she had ever prepared for someone.\n\n\"How peculiar!\" she mused. To wonder about someone's safety, or whether they even existed...  it was truly a novel feeling! Surely, it meant that she cared about their life. Such thoughts were foreign—she had never cared about her own life, or that of others. But after leaving the Stellar Matrix with {PlayerName} and discovering her identity as Lady Flora, she had begun to see things in a subtle new light. \n\nStill, she had no intention of following {PlayerName} to Rinascita. Their views on certain aspects of Solaris' history differed, and just as she did not intend to meddle in {Male=his;Female=hers} choices, she didn't feel the need to explain her own. In fact, to spare {PlayerName} from the added burden, she had kept some truths hidden from {Male=him;Female=her}. In the Stellar Matrix, she hadn't completely lost all memories of her past.\n\nYes, her past… Camellya squinted, a soft hum escaping her lips as she contemplated her next move. She wanted to investigate further on her own, biding her time until the moment felt right to share what she knew with {PlayerName}. She had little faith in the organization built on this shore, and even less in the Tethys System. Aside from {PlayerName}, she had little trust in anyone else.\n\nOnce, as Lady Flora, she had shied away from entanglements, unwilling to watch {PlayerName} sacrifice {Male=himself;Female=herself} for the greater good. But now her perspective had shifted. She saw little resemblance to the Lady Flora of her past. \n\nShe had followed {PlayerName} travels from Jinzhou till now. \n\nA singular force, always moving forward, gathering a diverse array of companions along the way. \n\nShe understood that this was still not her path, yet she no longer resisted observing it. Just as one pebble meets another, sending ripples across the water's surface, she embraced the idea of being a \"variable\" in this dance. Now, the joy she derived from their connection was profound. She felt no trace of the usual boredom creeping in, nor did she wish to erase thoughts of them. Instead, her thoughts often drifted to {Male=him;Female=her}, yearning to learn more about {Male=his;Female=her} adventures and share more delightful games. It was then Camellya realized that these thoughts had already left painful yet pleasing marks on her soul, long before she ever noticed.\n\nFeeling suddenly inspired, she activated her Terminal and drafted a brief message to {PlayerName}, set to send just before {Male=his;Female=her} departure. The bracelet allowed her to check on {Male=him;Female=her} anytime, so there was nothing to worry about. Though Solaris was vast, she believed that if they were threads in the same story, their paths would surely cross again.\n\nAt a time when {PlayerName} was none the wiser, that's when she would surprise {Male=him;Female=her}! \n\nAs she envisioned this delightful moment, a melody escaped her lips. Vines twisted around her arms, climbing upwards, as tiny buds began to bloom at their tips. \n\nSuddenly, a thought struck her.\n\n\"I will give {Male=him;Female=her} a flower.\"\n\nAs this idea took root in her mind, it consumed her completely. She had to find {PlayerName}—now! The flower, born from her very being, would neither wither nor decay unless she perished. She was stunned by her own eagerness and felt a flicker of sadness. As she reflected on it, a dull ache interrupted her thoughts.\n\nWith a sigh, she chose not to dwell on it. For… Yes! A smile graced her lips as she resolved to keep that flower blooming for {PlayerName}. She would do her utmost not to die too soon.\n\nCamellya leaped from the treetops, joyfully headed toward {PlayerName}, her cherished seed of fate."

        "content": "She awoke from her dream.\n\nThe walls of the medical pod sank into darkness. Enveloped in heavy silence due to sound dampening, Camellya blinked and turned her dry gaze to the right. The indicators on the Terminal screen had returned to normal. The shackles around her wrists and ankles had loosened, yet she still felt weak, forcing her to remain lying in the narrow confines of the pod.\n\nShe tried to recall what had happened. She forced a precarious composure trying to remember, but the lost memories felt like a bottomless black hole—gazing into it revealed only darkness. Her memories had fractured once again.\n\nHaving been with the Black Shores for only a year, Camellya had recently passed the test to become an official Bloom Bearer. She now enjoyed greater access to the Tethys System's archives of information.\n\nBefore her arrival there, she had wandered across Solaris for a long time.\n\nThe cave where she first awoke showed no signs of other people, only twisted plants climbing the walls. Barefoot, Camellya waded through the water until she emerged into the open air, discovering a desolate village. Her foot struck something—a stone slab bearing the faded inscription, \"Petalfall Village.\"\n\nIt took her a long time to escape that abandoned place. When hunger struck, she hunted wild beasts for sustenance. When thirst overtook her, she drank from mountain springs. It took her several months to traverse the dense forests and finally arrive at a place bustling with people. Only later did she realize that the village had likely been forgotten for hundreds of years.\n\nEven after returning to civilization, Camellya's memories remained blank, unstimulated by her new surroundings. She felt like an untamed animal, living on pure instinct. The rules and regulations of the human world were foreign to her, but she wasn't frustrated—using her Forte was enough. To her, power was an instinctive weapon, and she wielded it freely, carving her own path through the Lament-scarred land.\n\nInitially, everything in Solaris fascinated her. However, as she gradually learned more, boredom set in quickly. Arriving at the Black Shores had been an accident, yet Camellya felt a strange familiarity with it. A year later, she found her name in the Tethys System and learned that she had once lived and worked there, known then as Lady Flora. It was odd how she had forgotten everything yet still remembered the name \"Camellya.\" \n\nDriven by curiosity, she began her investigation of the Black Shores, eager to uncover her past and the stories of Lady Flora. What had truly happened to her?\n\nAs those thoughts surfaced, a sharp pain pierced her head again, and the flower in her chest suddenly swelled, darkening to a deep purple. The sharp thorns of its veins threatened to tear through the medical pod. Fragments of memories flickered in her mind—Ah, Lady Flora had forbidden her from recalling the past. Camellya let out a muffled scream of pain as the restraints tightened once again around her limbs, and a loud alarm blared. Medical personnel would arrive soon.\n\nYet, she knew there was little they could do. They had already examined her carefully, concluding that her Overclocking symptoms were unique and untreatable, manageable only through restraint. Death could offer relief, but in her current condition, she couldn't even simply die.\n\nAll she could do was wait, wait for the grace of death. This passivity chafed at her spirit. If she couldn't decide the outcome, she at least wanted to control the process. \n\n\"I'll follow my instincts until death finds me.\"\n\n\"It hurts!\" she thought.\n\nDespite her agony, Camellya laughed loudly."

She dawdled in her seat for a moment, slowly sitting up to take in her surroundings.\n\nThe vehicle had come to a halt in a cave, a refuge from the snowstorm outside, where an endless silver expanse of snow stretched before her. Frost flowers drifted gently from the sky, landing delicately on the tip of her nose. Shivering, she huddled deeper into her thick clothing. \n\nShe was not the kind of plant that could withstand the cold.\n\n\"Where did the leader go?\" she asked after taking a few sips of water, turning to the Bloom Bearer in the front seat. \"I didn't see {Male=him;Female=her}.\"\n\n\"The leader? {Male=He;Female=She} went west. {Male=He;Female=She} said something interesting had turned up and wanted to take a look.\" \n\n\"Why didn't {Male=he;Female=she} take me? I am {Male=his;Female=her} guard, after all!\" she complained under her breath.\n\nHer fellow Bloom Bearer chuckled as he drove, barely glancing away from the steaming soup. \"You were asleep! You haven't been sleeping well on the journey, always shivering in the cold. {Male=He;Female=She} didn't want to wake you while you finally caught some rest.\"\n\nGrumbling quietly under her breath, Lady Flora pouted and swung the door open. \"Anyway, I'm off to find {Male=him;Female=her} now!\"\n\nThe Bloom Bearer waved her off, clearly used to the dynamic between Lady Flora and their leader.\n\nLeaving the warmth of the vehicle, Lady Flora dragged her feet across the snowy expanse, memories of their first encounter in Petalfall Village flooding back. She had known they would come to this snowy plain for the mission, and despite her dislike of the cold, she knew the time spent with the leader of the Black Shores would be worth it. Most of the time, she opted to accompany {PlayerName} on various errands, leaving her footprints across the tapestry of Solaris, from bustling towns to unknown alcoves, safe havens to treacherous lands. Lady Flora relished this existence, brimming with the thrill of the unknown, and {PlayerName} had an uncanny talent for transforming the ordinary into something extraordinary.\n\nShe didn't mind the threat of danger. In fact, she rather enjoyed it. To her, danger signified change, and change led to excitement. She did find, however, that with her leader by her side, she stifled her impulse to seek out trouble for fun.\n\nDanger...\n\nCamellya raised her hand, the delicate chain on her wrist catching the light. The bracelet monitoring her Rabelle indicators read as normal. She squeezed her wrist and exhaled softly. \"Good, everything is as it should be,\" she thought. \"If I start spiraling out of control, {Male=he;Female=she} would have to look after me. It would derail the entire mission.\"\n\nShe hated losing control.\n\nIn recent years, Lady Flora had been haunted by bizarre and fragmented dreams. They felt like memories of a life she had never lived. In these dreams, she was always searching for {PlayerName}, but the two never found each other. Each time she jolted awake, a disquiet settled over her, the mental turmoil seeping into her very being. She was often forced to report to the Black Shores medical facility. \n\nThe thought soured her mood. \n\nShe needed to find {Male=him;Female=her} as quickly as possible.\n\nShoving those tangled thoughts aside, she focused on pinpointing {PlayerName}'s frequencies. After crossing two hills and a frozen lake, she finally spotted a blurry figure in the distance.\n\n\"Camellya, how did you sleep?\" \n\n{Male=His;Female=Her} golden eyes sparkled with warmth, and she couldn't help but smile back.\n\n\"Hehe… With my leader by my side, of course I had the sweetest dreams.\" she heard herself reply."

Lady Flora was starting to find it hard to tell where her dreams ended and reality began. She couldn't even recall when this disorientation had started.\n\nMemories surged like turbulent waves, crashing into her mind and wreaking havoc on her senses. Pain ripped through her body, relentlessly and unforgivingly. She opened her mouth to scream, but Overclocking had turned her throat into a gnarled, coarse root, silencing her cries. \n\nAfter struggling to take just a few faltering steps, she collapsed onto a muddy riverbank, trembling, her fingertips spasming uncontrollably.\n\nHow many times had this happened? She stared blankly at the dark night sky above.\n\nA void of chaos swirled within her, yet there was one thing that stood out in sharp relief: {PlayerName}.\n\nShe remembered everything now.\n\nWho she was, who {PlayerName} is, the reason for her being, Solaris, and the Lament…\n\nBefore the madness of Overclocking engulfed her, those memories were always buried deep, locked in the depths of her being. Each time she awoke, she lost all recollection, left only with an aching void. As time passed and her body weakened under the strain of Overclocking, glimpses of her mission and roots would resurface, only to vanish again in an endless cycle.\n\nHow many times had it happened? Lady Flora had no answer.\n\nCivilizations crumbled into dust, only to rise anew; life faded, only to blossom once more. \n\nShe was witness to the ebb and flow of Solaris, yet remained forever a wanderer in her own mind.\n\n\"{PlayerName}…\" The name slipped from her lips like a prayer. \n\nThey had never truly met or exchanged words, and now, with her memories fading, she couldn't even tell if they were friends or foes. Yet somehow, the next time she awoke she knew her instincts would lead her to seek {Male=him;Female=her} out. It was not a tender yearning. It felt more like the weight of a heavy chain, one Lady Flora could not resist. \n\nYet she felt no hatred for this chain. \n\nThe rustle of leaves shattered her reverie. Wearily, she blinked, and the red camellia unfurled, its vines piercing through the Tacet Discords lurking in the shadows. Yes, this was her instinct, her essence, the core of her being... Even as she teetered on the edge of forgetting everything, she could always rely on her instincts.\n\nIn truth, beyond her instincts, there was nothing left for her to hold onto. \n\n\"Next time, if only I could truly get to know {PlayerName} and share a conversation with {Male=him;Female=her}.\"\n\nLady Flora mused hazily. Perhaps the Tethys System would lead {PlayerName} to her since she had already revealed herself in this mission.\n\nLady Flora closed her eyes and surrendered to the darkness as the pain peaked.\n\nThe lake's cool water swelled across her cheek, the camellia withering as its vines retreated into her body.\n\nThe autumn night breeze blew through the leaves, caressing her as she lay by the lake. To the north, the villagers of Petalfall Village would soon awaken from their dreams, calling to one another as they prepared to set out on a new day of fishing."

Vehicles crisscrossed the roads, their taillights forming a vibrant, fiery chain. Resting her chin on her hand, she began to hum.\n\nIt was a song she had learned from {PlayerName}.\n\nOf course, she hadn't heard it directly from {PlayerName} {Male=himself;Female=herself}, she had picked it up secretly. \n\nThey might not be enemies, but their relationship was far from friendly—at best, it was a one-sided acquaintance. {PlayerName}'s presence had caught the eye of various factions, including her own organization. Yet, that hardly concerned her, nor was it something she could afford to contemplate.\n\nShe was merely a \"chosen seed,\" a \"flower\" that bloomed for the sole purpose of hunting {PlayerName} down. Most days, the injections left her in a fog, drifting through a semi-conscious haze, with only her instinctual yearning for a certain person carved deep into her heart.\n\nThe substance she was administered had a sharp, acrid scent, dragging her reason into a mire, robbing her of clarity and self.\n\nHer thoughts whirled chaotically, like a bomb on the brink of detonation, forced to reset just before the countdown expired. \n\nBut she didn't care. \n\nOutside of {PlayerName}, little else piqued her interest. Sometimes, {Male=he;Female=she} felt like a mere silhouette against a blank canvas, an outline of a stranger. The portrait was drawn from fragments of information she had painstakingly gathered—they were so close yet had never truly met. She didn't know what {Male=he;Female=she} looked like.\n\nIt was said this distance was necessary to evade the Tethys System's tracking. Contact was forbidden.\n\nBut how she longed to meet {PlayerName}!\n\nPerched dangerously on the edge of the building, she laughed at the fantasy. Vines entwined around her arms, climbing higher, their delicate buds slowly unfurling at their tips.\n\nSuddenly, a thought struck her.\n\n\"I'll give {Male=him;Female=her} a flower.\"\n\nThe moment the thought emerged, it consumed her entirely. She envisioned the moment she would find {PlayerName} and present this gift—a blossom sprouted from her very being. It would neither wither nor decay unless she perished. But just as quickly as it came, the thought vanished into the chaos of her mind, leaving no trace behind.\n\nLittle did she know, centuries later, the scene before her would vanish in the Lament. She would wander endlessly through a labyrinth of memories until one autumn morning, by a lake in Petalfall Village, where she would finally meet {PlayerName}, there to rescue the village from Tacet Discord attacks. From there, she would join the Black Shores and share a few hundred years together before {Male=he;Female=she} would eventually leave her. She, too, would leave the Black Shores, only to be reunited decades later in Jinzhou. All those futures had yet to unfold, just as possibilities slumbered within seeds, waiting for fate to blossom.\n\nShe leaped from the building, her vines weaving through the city's structures, searching for {Male=him;Female=her}."

According to Calcharo's report, he endured extended periods in hostile environments and faced numerous life-threatening situations. As a result, his Forte naturally awakened as a means of self-protection.\n\nResonator Calcharo's Tacet Mark is located on his forehead. When Calcharo activates his Forte, a golden core manifests on his chest. Concurrently, various parts of his body display characteristics of Tacet Discords, entangled with shadow-like thorns.\n\nNotably, Calcharo's body possesses a significantly higher amount of bioelectrical energy compared to the average human. He demonstrates exceptional awareness of and control over electric currents and magnetic forces.\n\nThe exact cause of Resonator Calcharo's Awakening cannot be identified at the moment, as his Spectrum Pattern does not show similarity to any known samples.\n\nAnalysis of test samples has revealed a non-convergent Rabelle's Curve with a gradual rise. Resonator Calcharo is thereby classified as a Natural Resonator.\n\n\n\"Actually... there is one strikingly similar Spectrum Pattern that we seem to have overlooked, or rather, we hesitated to entertain that possibility.\"\n\n\"Yes...

Risk of Overclocking is substantial.\n\nResonator Calcharo has a documented history of Overclocking. Maximum recorded Overclocking rating: Severe. \n\nDuring Overclocking, signs of Tacet Discord erosion spreads on Resonator Calcharo's body, and the golden Tacet Core on his chest flickers. It also significantly intensifies his Frequency fluctuations and conjures multiple phantom-like entities.\n\nNo major incidents of civilian injuries or property damage from Calcharo's Overclocking episodes have been found.\n\nResonator Calcharo possesses an extremely high risk of overclocking with an unidentified trigger. It is advised to raise his risk assessment level and closely monitor his condition."

Nowadays, he has grown even more ruthless for his mercenary: Poisoning, assassination, bribery, kidnapping, bombs... He'd do whatever he found necessary to get the job done. Rumors of Calcharo's impossible feats circulated endlessly. Some spoke of him staying in the desert for 7 days without water for a planned ambush, others of him donning bombs all over his body during a past negotiation. There were even whispers of him hiring killers to fake his assassination in a scheme to garner trust.\n\nWhile potentially exaggerated, the rumors were not entirely unfathomable to those who knew Calcharo personally. However, the stories became even more outlandish as time passed... \n\n\"He single-handedly stopped a truck at 12; when he turned 15, his Forte made the whole New Federation shudder in fear. He even fought the entire country's cops at 18 and left unscathed...\" \n\n\"His chest is home to the dead spirits, and his forehead bears curses of the gods. Beneath his feet strikes thunder, and out of his eyes shoots flames. His rage will never be quenched until heaven burns down...\" \n\n\"He has been to hell and back, time and time again... He will always come as a lightning, a phantom, and reclaim everything he deserves...\" \n\nThe latest rumors about Calcharo have become one of the go-to topics among the mercenary members when off-duty.\n\nBut the man himself seems unfazed... He's either desensitized already or scheming to capitalize on the rumors.\n\nIn the Lawless Zone, friends can become enemies in an instant—as common as changing air currents. Change is constant, even in the most unexpected places. What once seemed harmful can instantly become a useful tool. It all depends on how we choose to use it.\n\nRumors sow prejudices. Prejudices grow into misconceptions. Misconceptions produce misjudgments.\n\nAnd in a cut-throat game, misjudgment of enemy strength is always a bane."

Two, he had a flexible moral code that allowed him to work with all types of people.\n \nHe took the cash, he did the job. He promised, he delivered.\n \nFrom armed protection to disposal of hazardous materials, he always got the job done flawlessly. But if his clients reneged on their end, they were in for a lifetime of being hunted by Calcharo.\n \nSuch \"impartiality\" earned him fear and acquiescence from other powers in the area.\n \nCalcharo sees business as a mere exchange of values, where no job is too immoral, and no secrets are kept. Every transaction is fair game.\n \nNevertheless, value is not always weighed in terms of money. When faced with desperate, impoverished people begging for help, Calcharo would charge a symbolic fee of one Shell Credit in his own name. The grateful beneficiaries were unaware that this gift became their binding contract with Calcharo, and favors are never easy to repay.\n\nNever accept a deal that brings no benefits. That's Calcharo's core principle.\n\nThis approach allowed Calcharo to cultivate many eyes and ears among the common folk, creating a formidable intelligence network that spans all walks of life.\n\nVenal, merciless, and vengeful—these are just some of the words others used to describe Calcharo. Yet even his critics admit that his network has prevented much unnecessary bloodshed. No one can be sure if a lady selling street food in an alley is one of Calcharo’s informants.

As children, they were bullied and ousted, until one fearless boy united them. He observed those who were bullied and invited them to join. With strategic planning and unwavering bravery, the Underdogs gained notoriety among rival gangs.\n\nIn this gang, there was no hierarchy or politics—only a primal need for survival and freedom.\n\nHowever, the members died one after another: murdered by rivaling gangs, betrayed by those they trusted, or trapped by deceitful patrons.\n\nTime showed them no mercy in the Lawless Zone. It was every man for himself.\n\nIn the end, the leader boy decided to take fate into his own hands once again, risking it all in a daring gamble for power.\n\n...\n\nYears later, the New Federation waged war against \"the Underdogs,\" the last gang in the Lawless Zone. In a sudden twist, a new mercenary group known as \"Ghost Hounds\" annexed the \"Underdogs\" overnight and put an end to the chaos. \n\nOnly then did people discover that the mercenary group's leader shared a name with the former head boy of the \"Underdogs.\" \n\nHe had returned in a horrific figure, almost like a ghost. He was surrounded by shadowy thorns, and accompanied by fearsome phantoms. \n\nThis time, he would reach the top of the ladder, and finish what he once failed to accomplish due to naivety, sympathy, and indecisiveness. \n\nBut despite all the time that had passed, he couldn't shake off the memory of that one afternoon. The sun was shining down on them as they established the Underdog in a desolate dump site. \n\nIt was a rare moment of tenderness in his life."

It's a fatherly instinct he can't shake, always worrying about their well-being despite the inevitable bloodshed.\n\nTo ensure their safety, Calcharo made a set of rules:\n\n\"Team formation is free, but members must be informed and not coerced.\"\n\n\"Job details must be kept secret to external parties.\" \n\n\"Observe local laws and regulations.\" \n\n\"Betrayal is forbidden, punishable by execution.\" \n\n...\n\nBehind the rules lies Calcharo's deep care for his group.\n\nCalcharo has always known that the abyss looks back. Staying in this kill-or-be-killed business is never the best solution.\n\nTherefore, Calcharo decided to keep a low profile and start looking for legal business ventures.\n\nHowever, his caution drew threats as some new rivals attempted to replace Ghost Hounds. In an act of provocation, they severely injured a Ghost Hound recruit, breaking one of the \"unstated rules\" of the underworld.\n\nThe group thought they had gotten away with their actions against Calcharo, but the following day they were wiped out from the surface of the planet.

He then proposed a deal: He would assist the Midnight Rangers in their \"war\" against Tacet Discords, and in return, Jinzhou would collaborate with him.\n\nAfter careful consideration, Jiyan accepted this mutually beneficial deal.\n\nJiyan advised against Calcharo wearing his previous uniform while in Jinzhou city. Instead, he suggested adapting his attire to blend in and potentially stay for a long time due to the situation. \n\nFollowing diplomatic etiquette and for practicality's sake, Calcharo followed Jiyan's advice and adopted Huanglong colloquialisms and attire. While his new combat uniform was functional and flexible, the decorative ribbons and patterns perplexed him. Likewise, the Jinzhou people's unwarranted kindness left him bewildered.\n\nFamiliar with human cruelty, Calcharo could not help but suspect that this was all part of Jiyan's secret plot against him. But Jiyan simply assured him that he'd become used to it.\n\nNow, as the deal progressed, Calcharo has grown comfortable with the culture shock the Huanglong people brought him.\n\nOn the Loong-rising Day, one of the most celebrated festivals in Huanglong, Calcharo sat on a roof alone, watching over this \"defenseless\" city.\n\nPeople danced in costumes of Lions and Loongs. The air was filled with joy and festivity.\n\nDespite having endured countless battles and sacrifices, they still tried to live every day to the fullest.\n\nThese people showed him how grief is not the only way to honor the fallen. Celebrating life is another powerful way to say goodbye.\n\nIt wouldn't be bad to permanently base the Ghost Hounds in this city, Calcharo thought.\n\nThen something unusual interrupted his mulling.\n\nClouds were gathering, and thunder was crackling... Those were the omens of a forming Tacet Field.\n\nIf he and his people would eventually go live under the sun one day, then his mission was to dispel the darkness, as much as he could, before that shift eventually happened.\n\nCalcharo unsheathed his blade and walked into the dark night.

Her manipulation of these threads is extraordinarily proficient.\n\nHer Resonance Spectrum Pattern is found to be similar to the Spectrum Pattern of known conductive materials. Tests have found strong Syntony.\n\nAnalysis of test samples has revealed a non-convergent Rabelle's Curve with a noticeable periodic waveform, which classifies Yinlin as a Congenital Resonator.\n\nSIDENOTES: Yinlin has a preexisting arrhythmia that may or may not be related to her Forte. Blocking of her Forte could potentially increase the risk of atrial fibrillation.",

Both the upper and lower peak values are high and manifest proximity to the Criticality level. The waveform displays segments of partial fuzziness and abnormal waveform can be seen.\n\nResonant Criticality: Relatively low, with low stability. Risk of Overclocking remains.\n\nResonator Yinlin has no recorded history of Overclocking. Her body shows physical strength, but also signs of prolonged Overclock-inducing item exposure. Needs further monitoring.\n\nJudging from the observations so far, the risk of Overclocking is minimal. Resonator Yinlin is advised to avoid strenuous activity and erratic schedules."

Their duty involves upholding law and order while ensuring the safety of individuals and their possessions.\n\nHowever, there are also select Patrollers who are not able to don uniforms. They are not permitted to easily disclose their identities.\n\nThese individuals, known as Secret Agents, work covertly to infiltrate criminal organizations, gather proof of criminal activities, or prevent unlawful behaviors, all while maintaining their anonymity.\n\nInstead of dealing with minor theft, they frequently confront dangerous and malevolent criminals, and if their identities are exposed, it often leads to failed missions or even loss of life.\n\n...\n\n“Who in their right mind would want to be a Secret Agent?” the Exile Leader exclaimed, punctuating his words with a sharp stab of a dagger into the broken table. Everyone around burst into raucous laughter in the dim warehouse. \n\n“Any moles from the Patrollers here? Speak up now and I’ll save myself a seat at the celebration party.” \n\nThe group laughed again, though they couldn’t help stealing a couple glances at each other.\n\n“According to our intel, a convoy will depart from Jinchou tonight with valuable cargo. Thanks to the rumors we spread, the shipper didn’t work with Lollo Logistics.”\n\n“Great job, Ming,” the leader patted his sleazy-looking companion on the shoulder, who smirked in response.\n\n“Still, he hired a group of Resonators as bodyguards…”\n\n“Don’t worry about it. Hey newcomer, your turn is coming up soon.”\n\nThe leader turned his attention to a corner, where a woman with striking scarlett hair and a subtle grin on her face sat.\n\n“Boss... I’ve been meaning to ask, can this chick really hold her own in a fight? I’d hate for our crew to get taken down by someone who looks like they couldn’t even beat me.”\n\nMing’s lips curled into a sly grin as he reached for the woman’s arm. But just as his fingers were about to touch her smooth skin, he suddenly froze.\n\n“W-What’s happening? You wretched woman! What have you done to me?” \n\nThe Exile Boss scowled and waved his hand in frustration, noticing the glowing threads of lightning enveloping Ming.\n\n“Leave him be, for my sake. All he has left is his sharp tongue. Save your games for later.”\n\nThe woman calmly brushed her hair and the threads of lightning disappeared from Ming’s body.\n\n“Alright, let’s get this show on the road. Come on boys, it’s time to make it big!”\n\n...\n\nSome time later…\n\nMing lay on the ground, powerless and stunned as the convoy they were supposed to attack passed by in the distance. Memories of the events from earlier that day flooded his mind.\n\n(It’s the same paralyzing feeling… That woman! She’s the mole!)\n\nAs he struggled to get up and warn his team, he saw a horrifying puppet looming over him, causing him to let out a blood-curdling scream. \n\nBefore he could even process what was happening, a sudden flash of lightning drowned out his cries."

They appeared to be a father and son enjoying a holiday outing, but observant onlookers could sense the fear hidden behind the boy’s facade.\n\n“Yes, his beloved grandson is now in our hands... Once we send him out of Jinzhou, no one will find him.”\n\nThe man stared at the little boy beside him as he talked through the contact, signaling him not to mess around.\n\nWith this boy and his grandpa around, even the Patrollers in Jinzhou gotta watch out for us a bit... Let’s get in touch after I leave the city.”\n\nAs they approached the city gate with lax security, it was clear that the child’s grandpa had not reported the kidnapping — likely because he was also an outlaw himself.\n\nThe cloaked man hurried through many alleyways, but had to stop abruptly when he bumped into something.\n\nA woman dressed in vibrant attire with long scarlet hair, was performing a puppet show. Her captivating act drew a crowd of children and their parents. The flying puppets seemed so lifelike that all the children couldn’t take their eyes off them, including the young boy in his grasp.\n\nThe puppet show drew in a large crowd of children, making it difficult for him to maneuver through. But he didn’t have to rush, as the performance was coming to an end. \n\nAs expected, the woman with crimson hair took an elegant bow, amidst thundering applause and her puppet waving goodbye. Taking advantage of the break, he motioned for the boy to follow as they slipped through the bustling crowd.\n\n“Alright everyone, who wants to join me for the next show? Raise your hand!”\n\nSuddenly, the red-headed puppeteer asked with a dazzling smile, scanning the children in the audience. Almost all hands shot up in excitement.\n\n“Yes, you in the back with your father. Come on down!”\n\nAll eyes turned to the little boy with his hooded “father”, both surprised to be chosen.\n\n“Me...? Is she pointing at me?”\n\nThe little boy looked up at the man with a mixture of excitement and fear. After some hesitation, the man made their way to the front. \n\n“I’m sorry, but we’re in a hurry...”\n\n“It’s alright, it will be done soon... Will you join us too, mister?”\n\n“Me...? I’ll pass...” The man instinctively refused, but he failed to notice how the little boy had already wriggled free from his grasp.\n\nHe went to grab the boy, but only grabbed a weird puppet instead. In that instant, a strong electric current knocked him unconscious.\n\n...\n\n...\n\n“Boss! Bad news!” \n\nA rough-looking man burst into the old mansion, shouting loudly.\n\n“Idiot! Can’t you see I’m already annoyed?”\n\nStartled, the elder man in the center of the hall scolded him for his rudeness. Stressed and worried about his kidnapped grandson, he lost his usual calm demeanor and angrily threw his teacup at the intruder in frustration.\n\n“It’s that woman, that redhead woman returned... She had come back with our young master!”\n\n“What?”\n\nBefore the old man could fully comprehend, the woman in question walked inside, accompanied by a young boy — his kidnapped grandson. She was none other than the puppeteer who had just performed in the alleyway.\n\n“Grandpa!”\n\nAt the sight of the old man, the boy burst into tears and ran towards him, seeking refuge in his embrace. The old man was both surprised and delighted.\n\n“Oh, my sweet child...! Are you hurt? How did you make it?”\n\nThe boy shook his head to indicate that he was not hurt, and then pointed to the red-haired woman not far away.\n\n“This lady brought me back from the bad guys!”\n\n“Why are you here? A spy for the Patrollers, yet you want to help me?”\n\nThe redhead woman only gestured to her puppet, which revealed a hooded man, captured.\n\n“I’m only after them, they happen to be your enemy. I’m just using you,” she said nonchalantly. “But your grandson is innocent.”\n\nShe scanned the crowd of gangsters filling the hall, a sly smile playing on her lips.\n\n“Or do you really believe you can thwart me, the infamous mole, with your little crew?”\n\nThe old man closed his eyes and sighed, signaling for his men to lower their weapons.\n\n“Get out of here and don’t show your face again.”\n\nWith graceful poise, the woman exited. The old man sighed once more and let out a bitter laugh.\n\n“Grandpa, what are you laughing about?”\n\n“She's always in and out as if she knew I won't stop her, talking about we aren't the target 'yet'... Sounds like I'm never off the hook.”\n\nAs he gazed at his grandson’s cherubic face, the old man silently loses himself in thoughts."

With this deception, they could escape through a hidden passage and disappear from their pursuers’ reach. It was the only way to ensure their safety and protect the secrets hidden in his mentor’s former home.\nFrom that day forward, he and the baby girl in his arms would no longer be known by their former names. They would adopt new identities: new faces, new names.\nSilently, he took out an ugly mask from his pocket and put it on his face. Then, shielding the child’s eyes with his hand, they slipped away from the raging flames and vanished into the night without looking back.\n“From this moment on...

Master Dollmaker will create a fake identity for me.”\n\n“Maybe, but I don’t want to lose my family again... Please stay here at the Séance Society. Don’t go anywhere else.”\n\nThe Dollmaker shut his notebook and gestured for Lady Guan to halt. “Go for it, Yinlin. My research has reached a critical point and conflicts with the Jinzhou Public Security Bureau are inevitable. To have insiders among their high-ranking officials should prove beneficial to us all.”\n\n“No, I want to become a Secret Agent... just like my parents. I want to carry on their ideals in this way.” \n\nShe couldn’t see behind the Dollmaker’s mask, which he never removed in her presence since as far back as she could remember. But she caught a glimpse of complex emotions shimmering in his eyes — something rare and elusive.\n\nAfter a long pause, he finally nodded. “Before I bring your parents back with the puppets, you have the freedom to do whatever you please... Once my plan succeeds, we will seek revenge on the Public Security Bureau and eliminate all those who betrayed them in one swift strike!”\n\nYinlin tried to say something but Dollmaker had already turned his attention back to the puppet he was working on. In the end, she silently nodded before turning and leaving, knowing that they were now going their separate ways."

Hmm, how did you even...?”\n\nAs he continued to speak, realization dawned on him and a smirk spread across his face. \n\n“Aha, you’re a Secret Agent, aren’t you? How foolish to risk your life for something this trivial. Even if you were to uncover our secrets, what difference would it make?”\n\nAs Yinlin’s breathing grew fainter, the man knew her heart had stopped beating.\n\n“Time to finish you off. What a pity. You should have known not to mess with the Fractsidus...”\n\nBut just as his dagger was about to strike, a sudden surge of powerful lightning ran through it, paralyzing him in place.\n\n“How... How did you...”\n\nBefore he could pass out, he caught a glimpse of flickering lightning within Yinlin’s chest. She had given herself an electric shock to bring her heart back from the brink of death.\n\nYinlin manipulated her puppet, “Zapstring,” with flicks of her hands to advance on the man as she was too drained to move herself. From his pockets, she retrieved a set of documents.\n\n“The Fractsidus... It’s time to uproot this hidden darkness.”"

Lingyang has endured prolonged exposure to harsh environmental conditions and may have naturally activated his Forte during combat.\n\nLingyang bears a Tacet Mark on his right arm. No Post-Awakening mutations have been noted.\n\nHis physical endurance and strength are exceptional, likely due to his exposure to extreme environments. He displays advanced skills and agility in combat and survival, but lacks experience utilizing his Forte as it is not habitually used. Further evaluation is necessary to determine if proper guidance in Forte usage is needed.\n\nUnder the influence of his Forte, Lingyang's senses are heightened and he can generate an invisible freezing Gusto within a limited area. This also creates a low-temperature field that exerts pressure on nearby enemies. Additionally, Lingyang can influence and motivate the emotions of those near him through his transmitted will.\n\nNo instances of Resonance Spectrum Patterns similar to Lingyang's have been encountered. The cause of his Awakening remains unknown at this time.\n\nAnalysis of test samples has revealed a non-convergent Rabelle's Curve with a gradual rise. Therefore, Lingyang is identified as a Natural Resonator.\n\n\"What? So his 'beast-like' appearance wasn't a result of his Forte? What exactly is this...\"",

He displays proficient control over his Forte, consistently maintaining emotional stability. When utilizing his ability, known as \"Will Transmission,\" the low-temperature field generated primarily benefits Lingyang's allies.

Whether it’s grand events like freshman initiations and opening ceremonies or intimate occasions like birthday celebrations for the elderly and 100-day festivities for babies, there are always moments that call for a celebration ritual, and that’s why the Liondance Troupe consistently attracts a steady stream of clients.\n\nAs the leading Liondancer, his role extends beyond the thrilling and somewhat risky performances on the Plum Blossom Poles. Creating individualized liondance routines is a crucial aspect of his job, guaranteeing impactful performances that leave a lasting impression on clients.\n\nLingyang enjoys interacting with clients, diving deep into their needs to create a customized lion dance performance. But beyond his job, it’s a personal passion. For him, each person’s story is a treasure waiting to be unearthed, and he takes pleasure in unraveling them. His genuine curiosity often leads clients to open up and share their true thoughts. This can leave some wondering if they’re in the right place – has the Liondance Troupe started offering psychological counseling? \n\nThe Liondance Troupe navigates a world of tight schedules, last-minute changes, and unforeseen emergencies. Balancing conflicts and friction is a constant challenge, as one misstep could mean losing valuable clients. Thus, the key to their success lies in understanding and addressing each client’s emotions. Lingyang has mastered this art of negotiation, making it just another conquest in her repertoire.\n\nLuckily, Lingyang finds another way to deal with difficult clients: by giving Lucky Greetings. Armed with a bright smile and sincere well-wishes, Lingyang can make even the most unreasonable clients concede a bit. Gradually, his Lucky Greetings Collection has become essential reading for his fellow Liondancers, turning “giving Lucky Greetings to everyone” into a signature feature of the troupe.\n\n“Giving lucky greetings upon meeting someone. You must be from the Liondance Troupe, right? Please come in!”\n\nHowever, Lingyang’s lucky greetings aren’t one-size-fits-all. They should be sincere and tailored to the receiver. While it may have become a routine for the Liondance Troupe, Lingyang still puts effort into giving genuine and personalized blessings. He firmly believes that these greetings bring good luck to those who receive them.\n\nIf you come across a Liondancer showering you with lucky greetings, don’t be skeptical. Just accept his pure and sincere blessings, for it’s the best response to a kind and friendly soul."

        "title": "A Twist of Fate",
        "content": "Speaking of how Lingyang came to join the Liondance Troupe, we have to go back to that \"ordinary\" day when a liondance performance at the Jinzhou Theater had just concluded. As the staff were busy tidying up the stage props, a strange-looking youth dropped from the roof. To be more precise, it wasn't a mere \"drop\"; it was more like a \"crash\".\n\nAs it turned out, this was a carefully orchestrated accident. Lingyang had planned to approach the Liondance Troupe in advance. However, what he hadn't accounted for was the fact that rooftops, especially after a bout of rain, proved to be much slipperier than tree branches.\n\nBack then, Lingyang, who hadn't fully mastered human language yet, didn't even possess a name. He was simply referred to as the \"little guy\" by the members of the Liondance Troupe for a long time.\n\nDespite Lingyang's best efforts, he could not communicate with the troupe's staff. So, he resorted to a clumsy liondance performance using a head found elsewhere. \n\nWhenever the troupe members reminisced about this moment, they chuckled and commented that it seemed more like Lingyang was showing off his claws and teeth rather than performing a traditional liondance. \n\nWhile his intentions were understood, his unusual appearance sparked heated discussions among the troupe.\n\nIn the end, it was the eldest member, addressed as \"Master\" even by the current leaders of the Liondance Troupe, who decided to take Lingyang in.\n\nLingyang has tried many times to inquire about the reasons for taking him in, but all he gets are vague responses:\n\n\"Haha, maybe it's because your ears and tail resemble those of the legendary auspicious lions.\"\n\nOccasionally, during the master's nap, Lingyang overhears some sleep talk, \"'Big Lion'... I did it... My promise...\"\n\nUnder the guidance of this master, Lingyang has embarked on a formal journey of learning: delving into lion dancing, calligraphy, and learning how to interact with human beings.\n\nTo help Lingyang control the brutal force within his body, he was taught a set of ancient steps from Huanglong, which were believed to regulate energy flow and serve as the foundation for lion dancing. With diligent practice, Lingyang officially earned the title of \"Lion Head.\"\n\nIn Jinzhou, the term \"Lion Head\" carries multiple meanings. For ordinary people, it can refer to the \"liondance head\" used in the performance, or the lead performer. While for the Liondancers, it refers to a shared dream—the aspiration to become the \"head of lions\" through diligent practice and perfected lion dancing skills.\n\n\"I was born with this strength and honed my hunting skills in the wild. However, liondancing is more than just pure strength—posture, steps, rhythm, coordination with teammates... It's not something that can be learned overnight. My master emphasizes how lion dancing means a lot to the Jinzhou people, and I can't help but worry that I might not be meeting their expectations. To live up to the title 'Lion Head', I know I've got to put in more work.\"\n\nAccording to his master, Lingyang isn't just talented. More importantly, he possesses an insatiable desire for progress.\n\nHe strives to master every new move, practicing tirelessly until the sky is cloaked in stars. Often, Lingyang stands atop the Plum Blossom Pole in the Central Plains, gazing at his reflection in the water, as if contemplating or challenging his limits. Amidst falling petals, the young Lion Head dances passionately on the poles, creating a unique spectacle in the region."

        "content": "One cannot mention Central Plains without bringing up the Liondance Troupe’s annual winter training.\n\nDuring the winter off-season, the Liondance Troupe gathers in Taoyuan Vale for intensive training at their grounds. This preparation is vital for their upcoming performance at the “New Year Parade,” a highly significant event in Jinzhou that symbolizes bidding farewell to the old year and welcoming the new. Despite the off-season, the troupe is hard at work refining characters, honing skills, crafting props, and rehearsing new performances. Leisure is not an option during this crucial time. On the other hand, since they are leaving city for the wilderness, Lingyang gets the chance to embrace his nature.\n\nEven in the winter chill, Lingyang’s inherent liveliness keeps him active, much like the fierce beasts inhabiting the nearby mountains. \n\nAs snow blankets the world, these creatures eagerly hunt for their prey. Whenever Lingyang heard their growls and distant cries for help, he’d rush into the woods during breaks to deal with the threats. He employed a savage and brutal approach against attacking beasts, tearing them apart with lightning speed.\n\nThe rescued were grateful, yet their demeanor showed fear.\n\nLingyang couldn’t help but wonder:\n\n“Are they still afraid of those beasts? Or... Are they worried I might end up tearing them apart too?”\n\nConfronted with people’s fear again and again, Lingyang started realizing his differences from humans: his claws and teeth, wielded in the heat of combat, bore a striking resemblance to the very beasts he fought.\n\nCan people really accept this part of him?\n\nPerhaps... He needed to find a more acceptable way to help others, out of kindness at least?\n\nSoon, a rumor began circulating in Jinzhou: every winter, a strange creature with a lion head appears to those who cry out for help in the Central Plains.\n\nAs people discovered that this mysterious being meant no harm, fear turned into fascination, and the creature became known as a guardian deity, watching over travelers during the cold months.\n\nWell, these are tales for another time. Anyway, Lingyang must now prioritize his master’s mood.\n\nLately, when he’s supposed to be at rehearsal, Lingyang is often missing from the gym.

        "content": "“What did the land at the outskirts of Huanglong look like?” Not even the oldest researchers could provide an answer to this question.\n\nLegends passed down by the storytellers speak of a land shrouded in lush forests, teeming with life and home to a sacred creature revered by all. But that was before the Lament descended upon the world, transforming this once vibrant land into a desolate field of frozen soil and eerie quiet. \n\nLingyang’s memories only recall this barren landscape, for as long as he can remember.\n\nLingyang can’t pinpoint when he first remembered things, but he knows nothing of what happened before that. He couldn’t recall when he was born, where he had lived, or where he was going to. After fleeing the destruction of his homeland, he roamed the wilderness alone, struggling against loneliness, harsh weather, and emptiness. He felt like a wild beast, surviving on instinct with no direction in life. But everything changed when he stumbled upon a human military troop.\n\nIn the forest during a hunt, Lingyang encountered these peculiar upright animals. He cautiously followed behind them, keenly observing their every move.\n\nLingyang couldn’t help but feel a mix of curiosity and amazement.\n\nDespite facing formidable enemies, they refused to surrender or flee. \n\nEven when injured, they shielded their comrades and shared vital supplies.\n\nNot even hunger could weaken their resolve to share vital supplies and help one another.\n\nLingyang wondered why these upright-walking creatures consistently exhibited behaviors he couldn’t comprehend.\n\nHowever, somehow their “strange” behaviors ignited a small flame within Lingyang’s heart, thawing some of the fear and coldness that gripped him.\n\nYears passed, but Lingyang couldn’t shake the vivid memories of those figures. He found himself following their scent and footprints until he arrived at an unfamiliar land - Jinzhou.\n\nStanding on a cliff, he gazed at the strange creatures’ lively habitat in the distance. Thunderous gongs and drums startled him, until he realized they were gathering at the city gate.\n\nLingyang was filled with joy as he watched a vibrant and familiar dance unfold before him. The strange lionheaded dancer stirred something deep within him, a feeling rooted in his bloodline that he had been searching for all along.\n\nAfter deciding to join these peculiar creatures, Lingyang would invest immense effort and endure pain in pursuit of his long-sought purpose, but his resolve always remained unshaken."

However, fate took a surprising turn when Lingyang discovered that his Forte is related to the bone-chilling ice.\n\n“But no one loves coldness,” he pondered, “Despite surviving the cold countless times, I still fear it. How am I supposed to help others overcome their fear with this ability?”\n\nFrustration led Lingyang back to the training grounds, where he threw himself into the rhythmic dance on the Plum Blossom Poles, as if seeking an outlet for his inner turmoil.\n\nIt was there that his master approached, sensing Lingyang’s struggle, and encouraged him to open up about his feelings.\n\n“Haha, I see. By the way, little guy, you don’t have a name yet, do you?” the master asked.\n\n“A name? Is it important to have one?” Lingyang responded.\n\n“For us humans, yes. A name carries the weight of expectations and good wishes from parents. But whether you fulfill those expectations or defy them is entirely up to you,” the master explained and continued, “Since you can’t recall your past and we can’t find your parents, how about choosing your own name? Little guy, what kind of person do you want to be in the future?”\n\n“Person?” Lingyang questioned, prompting the master to rephrase, “What do you most want to do right now?”\n\n“Oh! I want to stand on the highest Plum Blossom Pole in the world! The one that’s higher than the sun!”\n\n“Haha, that’s a big dream! But those who stand too close to the sun may get burned and melt, you know?”\n\n“Hmm... that could be a headache, but I’m not afraid! I want to bring joy and peace to everyone. And! I also want to become someone who can bring warmth and courage to people! If the sun melts me, I’ll become much hotter than the sun and melt it first!”\n\n“Hahaha, ambitious, huh? Alright then. How about ‘Lingyang’? It reflects your ambition to surpass the sun—the 'Yang'.”\n\n“Now that you have a name, it means you’re an independent individual from now on. You can think of this day as your birthday.”\n\n“Birthday? What’s that?”\n\n“Well, a birthday is a day humans use to reflect on the passage of time and the fleeting nature of life. More importantly, it’s a day to celebrate our birth, being grateful for all the wonders we’ve encountered along our journey of growth.”\n\n“Then...”\n\n“Happy birthday! Lingyang!”\n\nLingyang’s seniors suddenly appeared by his side, shouting “Lingyang” in unison.\n\n“Ling... yang...”\n\nLingyang silently repeated this most precious gift of this life in his heart. He muttered it softly as if contemplating its profound meaning. With his heart racing, Lingyang made a silent vow to live up to the expectations contained within his name and to protect his loved ones.\n\nSomeday, his presence would thaw the icy hearts and bring warmth to people’s lives, like the sun emerging from behind dark clouds."

Luckily, I can still manage to pull off the performance smoothly, thanks to my fellow troupe members. They often tweak the drumbeat tempo to match my rhythm.

      "doc": "Evaluation Basis: [Resonance Assessment 1425-G]\n\nThe exact time of Resonator Yuanwu's Awakening is unclear. Resonator Yuanwu recounted that he was exposed to powerful electrical energy for extended times before his Awakening.\n\nResonator Yuanwu's Tacet Mark is located on the right side of his neck. After his Awakening, blue crystal-like structures appeared on his front limbs, with scar-like tissue visible on his hands and wrists. These changes have since stabilized.\n\nResonator Yuanwu has extraordinary control over the frequency fluctuations of his body. He can engineer the amplitude and range of his frequencies in an instant, seemingly without doing any harm to himself. Tests have concluded that he is 82.58% more proficient in manipulating frequencies than the average Resonator.\n\nThe Resonance Spectrum Pattern of Yuanwu has been observed to align closely with that of thunder. A strong Syntony reaction has been observed, yet the cause of Yuanwu's Awakening remains unclear.\nAnalysis of test samples has revealed a non-convergent Rabelle's Curve with a gradual rise. Resonator Yuanwu is thereby classified as a Natural Resonator.",
      "certification": "Resonator Yuanwu's waveform graph shows elliptical fluctuations. Pattern of the Time Domain appears stable with no abnormal waveforms observed.\n\nResonant Criticality: Relatively high. Resonator Yuanwu's frequency displays high stability with minimal risk of Overclocking.\n\nPrevious records indicate no history of Overclocking; however, in Resonator Yuanwu's adolescence, during the earliest recorded use of his Resonance Ability, there was a near Overclocking event that produced violent frequency fluctuations and uncontrolled behavior. The incident was classified as a Class 2 hazard and archived under code EX42978.\n\nSubsequent examinations revealed that this episode was caused by emotional distress. No aftereffect of Overclocking was noted.\n\nPresently, Resonator Yuanwu's psychological state is deemed stable and healthy. Routine examinations are advised to prevent future incidents of Overclocking."

Then he boils a pot of tea and greets customers while savoring it.\n\nFor those seeking to learn martial arts, Yuanwu assesses their physique and current condition before suggesting a suitable style. The intensity of training can be tailored to individual preferences, whether for physical fitness or making a name in the martial arts world. Every customer is heard attentively, with Yuanwu patiently crafting a personalized practice plan for their goals. Even those who enter without a clear purpose are welcomed with warm hospitality and offered guidance in exploring their interests.\n\nAs soon as a client steps through the gym’s front door, Yuanwu’s kind eyes immediately meet theirs. \n\n“Leave your worries behind and lift your spirits in our gym. Let’s start with some easy punches to unwind.”\n\nFrom just a few moves and punches, Yuanwu can tell the guest’s current physical condition and recommend a suitable training plan.\n\n“Your posture is slouched, and your walk lacks stability... The lower back muscles appear strained. Try this set of moves: three slow punches followed by one fast. This should provide relief.”\n\nAfter practicing as per his instructions, the customer should feel a significant sense of relaxation, both mentally and physically. Before leaving, Yuanwu would say goodbye with just the right amount of genuine concern, almost like an old friend.\n\n“Feeling better now? That’s good. And don’t forget to ease up on those usual tense days. Take this pack of tea with you, it’ll help you unwind.”\n\nAmong the numerous boxing gyms of various sizes in Jinzhou, only Yuanwu’s gym enjoys such sustained popularity."

        "title": "Bad Bargain",
        "content": "It is said that Yuanwu Boxing Gym’s owner is willing to help his customers with any kind of trouble, even those not related to working out.\n\nOne day, Mahe, a customer usually focused and devoted during workouts, was suddenly off his game. Yuanwu picked up on that and asked him if something was wrong. Mahe’s demeanor was somber as he led Yuanwu to the gym’s locker, where he pulled out a delicate dinner plate from his belongings.\n\nThe plate had a circle of small red flowers on the edge. Yuanwu recognized it as an enamel craft from overseas. The flowers were perfect, except for a small missing piece of the gold rim. The entire plate appeared incomplete without it.\n\nIt was a gift Mahe prepared for Panhua. A few years ago, when Panhua Restaurant opened, Mahe promised that he would find the world’s most beautiful dinner plate to serve the world’s most flavorful meals. Even though the two of them later parted ways due to differences in ideals, Mahe still remembered his promise.\n\nHe stuck to his ideals, but couldn’t let go of his affection for her.\n\nFor years, he searched for the perfect dinner plate, one that wasn’t too flashy or tacky. Finally, his eyes landed on this simple yet elegant piece - white with red flowers. It was just right.\n\nThe plate was expensive, and he had a hard time securing the funds to buy it. His anxiety mounted as he debated whether to give the gift. Would it be appropriate? Should he send it anyway? During his hesitation, a section of the filigree gold rim that adorned the plates went inexplicably missing. He asked all the vendors in Jinzhou, but they either weren’t familiar with imported porcelain or didn’t dare to attempt fixing such valuable items. Mahe was left in a predicament.\n\nHaving listened to Mahe’s situation, Yuanwu gently picked up the dinner plate, telling Mahe to come pick it up a week later.\n\nWhen Mahe came back, the flowers were perfectly arranged in a circle, with no signs of repair.\n\nIn return, Yuanwu only asked Mahe to bring him and the repaired plate to Panhua Restaurant for a meal.\n\nServed on the beautiful plate adorned with enameled flowers, the spicy, fragrant dishes looked even more enticing. Panhua’s smile looked peculiarly charming that day, and the usually reticent Mahe managed to put a smile on his face too. It was truly an enjoyable dinner.\n\nNo matter how popular the gym was as a business, to charge so little for work like this seemed like a bad bargain to many.\n\nYuanwu, however, simply shrugged it off with a smile, as if money was the least important thing to him."

        "content": "Located on the frontier, Jinzhou boasts a robust martial arts culture, featuring numerous gyms of varying sizes. In this relatively tranquil era, the once stringent and harsh customs governing duels gradually waned, making way for more \"amicable\" consultations and exchanges between gyms.\r\n\r\nWhere people gather, politics inevitably follows. Despite the activities being cloaked under the banner of exchanges, behind the scenes, individuals engaged in secret competitions, employing every means to emerge victorious. After all, this provides a rare opportunity for publicity. A simple statement from the winner about their affiliated gym brings about a surge in attention and lucrative business contracts.\r\n\r\nAs the event gains more influence, an increasing number of gyms decide to participate. Surprisingly, even Yuanwu, known for his indifference to fame and fortune, threw his hat into the ring.\r\n\r\nYuanwu's gym was already a flourishing and enviable business. His participation immediately stirred up trouble among some vested interests, with the most perturbed being the previous top-ranker, Wenxi. Wenxi, a businessman, treated both his gym and participation in the event as mere publicity tools for his weapon workshop, emphasizing commercial benefits. Notably, his top rank was purchased, not earned.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding Yuanwu's capabilities and recognizing that his gym was not overly corporate, Wenxi personally visited and extended a tempting offer to buy out Yuanwu. However, Yuanwu rejected the proposal without a second thought.\r\n\r\nUnfazed, Wenxi resorted to paying substantial sums to some of Yuanwu's regulars to divulge every detail of Yuanwu's boxing techniques. He then went on to bribe the referees and staff overseeing the finals, ensuring they turned a blind eye to the tampering he did with the fighters' suits.\r\n\r\nOn the day of the finals, a surprising surge of thunder filled the air, only to dissipate in an instant. Between the flash and the sudden calm, both suits were struck open. The scorching thunder precisely hit the costumes, avoiding unprotected skin; a little further, and the fighters' joints would have been burned. The exposed inner workings of the broken suits revealed all the clandestine schemes, causing an uproar among the spectators and thus leading to the suspension of the match.\r\n\r\nFollowing an investigation, the horrifying thunder during the match was attributed to accidents caused by the concealed devices within the suits. Simultaneously, Wenxi's weapon workshop, responsible for manufacturing such devices, came under scrutiny.\r\nBefore long, the workshop mysteriously vanished, fading into oblivion along with the rigged fighting events.\r\n\r\nAfter the storm had settled, Yuanwu Boxing Gym returned to its usual lively state, a small haven bustling with patrons. For the sharp-eyed customers, a subtle difference might be observed–a few familiar faces were absent from the crowd coming in and out of the premises."

        "title": "Soothing Tea",
        "content": "The standout feature that sets Yuanwu Boxing Gym apart from others is the emphasis on comfort.\r\n\r\nUnder Boss Yuanwu's guidance, practitioners go through their routines, ending each session by wiping away the sweat and indulging in a pot of tea. The comfort! Whether practicing the nimble Xianfengquan, the powerful Leihuangquan, or the flexible Sanfuquan, Yuanwu has paired each style of boxing with a specific tea boasting complementary benefits. Practitioners, sipping the hot brew after their workouts, relax their muscles, invigorate circulation, and dispel fatigue.\r\n\r\nYuanwu personally tested these tea formulas before handing them over to the neighboring teahouse, which thrives with a booming business. Requests for tea bookings are usually made months in advance, and while occasional delays occur, they never affect Yuanwu's orders to be delivered as scheduled. Speculations arise about Yuanwu not being the ordinary, idle gym boss he appears to be, but rather a big shot overseeing multiple enterprises. Could this highly sought-after tea be just another facet of his business?\r\n\r\nWhen confronted with inquiries, Yuanwu merely smiles and hands over a cup of tea, saying, \"Stop chasing shadows. Have some tea and refresh. Sweat more, conjecture less.\" After a practice session and a cup of tea, with the nose filled with the fresh aroma, doubts and anxieties disperse with the droplets of sweat. Questions about Yuanwu's wealth and how he accumulates it become irrelevant. A profound sense of relaxation envelops the whole body, momentarily dispelling worldly plots and pursuits.\r\n\r\nIn this world, most things demand pace and balance. When tired, take a break and enjoy some tea. It's a moment to pause, refresh, and then continue."

        "title": "Timeless Heritage",
        "content": "Yuanwu Boxing Gym was once renowned as the gym for Leihuangquan successors. The gym boasted countless honors, and each of its masters achieved fame across Huanglong.\r\n\r\nLeihuangquan's reputation rests on its aggressive style, but such intensity often comes at a cost. Unfortunately, the last three masters met rather unfortunate fates, with the most recent one experiencing a particularly tragic downfall. Rumor has it that he, in the heat of competition, punched through the boxing equipment, violating the rules and leading to his expulsion. Seeking solace from the blow to his career, he embarked on a ship tour, only to encounter a fatal thunderstorm. Coincidentally, he possessed a skill for manipulating thunder, and in a twist of cruel irony, he succumbed to the very force he once controlled. It seems that karma refuses to let anyone go.\r\n\r\nAs the property agent finished his introduction of the gym's history, he paused to gauge the middle-aged man's reaction. \"This property isn't really auspicious. Do you still want to buy?\" The man simply smiled and nodded, undeterred.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I've said everything I have to,\" the agent sighed, cautioning, \"If you still want to buy it, go on, but just don't turn it into a martial arts gym again. It's unlucky.\"\r\n\r\nYuanwu pushed open the creaky wooden door, allowing sunlight to spill into the space. Dormant dust danced in the hard-earned sunlight's warmth, settling on familiar yet weathered furnishings—the worn wooden stakes, the boxing ring with a worn floor, the quiet display case, and dusty medals of honor.\r\n\r\nYuanwu delicately wiped down these objects from the past, along with memories obscured by dust. The wooden stakes bore the marks of his late fellow apprentices' intense practice. The medals in the display case were hard-earned victories, and as for the floor, it was indeed broken by himself.\r\n\r\nBack in the match, he knew no fear and no restraint. A single punch shattered the delicate balance maintained by masters over the years, breaking the floor and throwing him into the storm of reality. The storm, which was also called reality, tore apart the young martial artist who knew nothing but fight. Perhaps, as the rumors suggested, he was truly buried in the bottom of the sea.\r\n\r\nAs the gym reopened under new ownership, a middle-aged owner with a warm smile welcomed customers coming and going. \"Welcome to Yuanwu Boxing Gym.\""

The source of Awakening cannot be determined at this time.\n \n Analysis of test samples has revealed a non-convergent Rabelle's Curve with a stable rise. Occasional fluctuations within normal range have been detected. Therefore, Jianxin is identified as a Natural Resonator.\"",

Agile and free, she roamed the fields with her animal companions.\n\nAs Shiling ventured into the forests, a strange noise caught his attention. He glanced over and saw a child among the branches, with pure eyes and an innocent demeanor.\n\nSuch a rare, untainted soul, untouched by the world's corruption.\n\nEnthralled by her gaze, Shiling cautiously approached, but the girl retreated higher, wary of him.\n\nShiling noticed her thin frame and ragged clothing, so he pulled out a piece of flatbread for her. She eagerly snatched it, shielding it with her body in a feral manner. Her behavior seemed undomesticated, as if she had forgotten her humanity. In response, Shiling placed another piece of flatbread next to hers.\n\nShould I bring this child with me and make her my apprentice? Sitting cross-legged next to her, Shiling pondered while watching her eat the flatbread. But we are currently short on funding... It may be difficult support another child, he thought. Ultimately, he decided to let the girl choose her own path.\n\n\"Hey, kid, you see this path ahead? This is the only path up the mountain, where my sect is located. Our founder spent every effort to open it up back then. If you can catch up with me and climb to its top before sunset, I will make you my new apprentice. How about that?\"\n\nDespite his offer, the girl continued to eat as she blinked at him nonchalantly, as if she didn't understand what he was saying at all.\n\nHaving set his heart on the promise, Shiling stood up and started to climb up the mountain. He looked back now and then, hoping for a change of heart from the girl, but she remained rooted in place, fixated on her meal.\n\nDisappointed, Shiling resigned himself to leaving her behind and continued on towards the top. As he neared his sect atop the mountain, faint laughter drifted from near the hall gate. Approaching, he saw his students crouched, offering water to the girl he had just left behind.\n\n\"Master, you're back. Look, this kid climbed up the mountain all by herself.\"\n\n\"W-When did she arrive?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I have been here for a while, and she was here before I arrived.\"\n\nWithout saying anything else, Shiling extended his hand to the still girl, who remained motionless, not understanding the meaning behind his gesture.\n\nShiling took her hand and placed it firmly in his. He guided her up, and they walked side by side into the hall."

I revere the elders in my sect, always trying to assist them.\" \n\n\"When I said 'love', I meant to help those in need and care for the suffering people in this troubled world,\" Rongfu explained. \n\n\"Master Shiling once said something similar. But what good does it do?\" Jianxin questioned.\n\n\"The best sages gain enlightenment in the military, the mediocre sages gain enlightenment in the bustling cities, and the worst sages gain enlightenment in seclusion. Tao cannot be attained solely through solitude or meditation. It is through real-life interactions with others that one can achieve both spiritual freedom and physical elevation. Seeking personal gain and lacking in meditation shows a misguided pursuit of Tao. Instead, seek insight into your path and strive for perfection in all aspects of life.\"\n\n\"Then how can I learn to love?\" Jianxin asked.\n\n\"You have never left this mountain, have you?\" Rongfu asked. \n\n\"No,\" Jianxin replied. \n\n\"Perhaps it wasn't time for you to leave. But now, the time has come. How can you truly attain Tao without truly experiencing the world?\"\n\nRongfu sat beside Jianxin, and the two of them talked for a long time on the bridge about what it means to love people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Master Rongfu, long time no see!\"\n\n\"Jianxin, since our paths have crossed again, why not join me in helping those in need?\"\n\n\"Sure do!\"\nHearing their heartfelt thanks and feeling the warm touch of their unfamiliar hands, Jianxin knew her actions had made a small impact. A smile lit up her face, replacing any previous confusion."

Enlightenment is a solitary journey. Answers must be found alone, with one's own hands and unique approach. No one can aid her in this pursuit.\n\n\"Listen to your heart and forge your own path. Life's lessons are more than chance encounters. Harness their power and let your soul flourish with wisdom.\" \n\nWith Shiling's guidance, she embraced self-spiritual cultivation and let go of her past achievements. Taoism's natural principles taught her to appreciate and love the world around her, harnessing the emotions of others as her own strength. In a state of intense concentration, she relied on simple martial arts techniques to connect with the world around her. It was a near-madness state, but one that brought unity and harmony. Her fists and palms held the world and her ego, merging into one. Each punch carried compassion and benevolence, repeated three thousand times. Turbulent thoughts settled into a stronger spiritual power. \n\nShe stood in the same place, mastering basic techniques three thousand times, regardless of the seasons. Sitting on the grass, she became one with nature. Breathing in harmony with the wind and feeling the vitality of the surrounding greenery, she entered a state of symbiosis. Mind, body, and environment merged into a natural flow, cultivating peace within.\n\nWhen the mind is calm, the strength becomes gentle. When the strength is gentle, the essence becomes solid. When the essence is solid, the spirit becomes vigorous. \n\nNow, Jianxin's martial arts practice has evolved beyond physical boundaries, fueled by a strong inner power that is impervious to external influences. In her world, every moment is focused and intense, a reflection of the vibrant natural world. Her punches move at invisible speeds, harnessing the power of wind with gentle force. Through her softness, she conquers all obstacles with love and reverence for the world around her."

They traversed countless barren wastelands and perilous jungles until they finally reached a picturesque place embraced by lush mountains and clear water.\n\nStanding at the end of the forest path were towering city gates. Soldiers on guard gave them a friendly welcome, granting them entry after a quick check of their papers.\n\nA lively tapestry of life unfurled before them as they ventured into Jinzhou. Contrary to expectations, the city was a bustling hub of activity and lacked any trace of desolation or bleakness. Amidst well-designed buildings and serene ponds teeming with colorful carp, they discovered a captivating scenery that rivaled even the lush landscapes of inland regions. Lost in the lively atmosphere, they sampled Kungfu Tea at Liuxian Teahouse, savored the specialty dish at Panhua's Restaurant, and immersed themselves in the shows at Jinzhou Theater.

She also understood that trust had to be earned through hard work and dedication.\n\nDespite the skepticism she encountered, Jinhsi was more troubled by the weariness etched on the faces of the people—a weariness born of life's hardships and a lack of hope.\n\nShe realized that beyond addressing tangible issues like material shortages and external threats, her true challenge was to restore the hope and confidence of the people of Jinzhou, who had been worn down by life.\n\nIn such times, what the people needed most was a reliable source of hope, regardless of who provided it.\n\nDuring a reconstruction event, the young magistrate performed a \"miracle\" known as \"Sentinel Granting Wishes.\" The remote village had been plagued by weather anomalies for years. Even though the Tacet Discords had stopped, villagers still suffered from extreme cold and gloom.\n\nJinhsi asked the villagers to voice their wishes. At first, silence hung heavy until a sneeze broke the silence. A timid voice then followed, \"It's so cold… I wish it was a bit warmer here.\"\n\nStanding amidst the crowd, Jinhsi held a Loong Scale, closed her eyes, and nodded, \"I will convey your wish to the Sentinel.\"\n\nRight after her words fell, loong horns sprouted from her head, and a Sentinel-like light pierced the dark clouds and the snow on the ground—just in an instant, the ice thawed, and the land once again sprang to life.\n\nWitnessing this spectacle, the crowd exclaimed, \"The Sentinel... the Sentinel has shown itself!\" People observed the loong-shaped light in awe, with hope rekindling in their eyes.\n\nNews of the young magistrate's wish-granting ability spread rapidly in Jinzhou. Wishing became a popular custom, with people submitting their desires to her at City Hall. She meticulously examined each one and devised effective strategies to fulfill them.\n\n\"Dear Magistrate, I'm worried about Tacet Discords infiltrating our city.\"—Taoqi, director of the Defense Division, was then tasked with fortifying the city defense walls.\n\n\"Dear Magistrate, I pray for my father's safe return and an end to the war.\"—Jinhsi prioritized research on Tacetite weaponry and material engineering, pushing for new weapons against Discords and faster upgrades for defense.\n\n\"Dear Magistrate, the Exiles have been spotted in the city. I'm scared.\"—Jinhsi expanded Patrol Stations, added Patrollers in the city, and assigned more Midnight Rangers to guard outside.\n\nWithin three years, the city defense walls were renewed, new weapons were created, and Tacet Discords were repelled. Jinzhou finally ushered in peace and prosperity.\n\nAs time passed, people came to realize that the so-called \"Sentinel Granting Wishes\" was just a white lie from the young magistrate.\n\nHowever, they also discovered her true dedication to addressing their problems and concerns, always being on the spot at lightning speed.\n\nThe lights in City Hall never went out, even on holidays. Jinhsi worked tirelessly until midnight, developing feasible plans to fulfill people's wishes. \n\nAnd eventually, they came to understand that she possessed an incredible power - without a Loong Scale, she could summon a dazzling light that could pierce through ice and turn the tide of time.\n\n...\n\nToday, making wishes has become a habit for Jinzhou people, an unspoken agreement between them and their young magistrate.\n\n\"Dear Magistrate, I hope you can take some time to relax and come watch our latest show.\" This was the last wish of the year.\n\nSmiling, Jinhsi closed the file in her hands, leaned against the window in her office, and listened to the melodious singing from Jinzhou Theater, where the new Hero Play, Loong Maiden and Wishes, was being performed."

        "content": "In any situation, Jinhsi always wears a gentle smile, reassuring those around her, \"There's still much to do, but rest assured, I'm here to guide you through it.\"\n\nBack then, Tacet Discords ravaged the lands, and warriors fought for every piece of land. People dreaded the thought of bidding farewell to loved ones heading to the front lines, uncertain if those farewells might be forever.\n\nAfter witnessing the despair and anguish in her people's eyes, the newly appointed young magistrate couldn't bear to add to their sorrow. She understood that revealing her own distress would only weaken the hard-earned confidence and hope they held onto amidst adversity.\n\nThus, she never let a hint of despair show, always exuding composure.\n\nDespite her unwavering smile and gentle demeanor, Jinhsi was aware that without tangible results, her actions may be perceived as insincere or ignorant of the people's suffering. To counter this, she resolved to be a proactive magistrate, tirelessly working to address their concerns and guide them towards a life of happiness and peace.\n\nWhile the Midnight Rangers valiantly fought to protect Jinzhou, a different yet equally difficult battle raged within the city walls.\n\nFamilies of soldiers grappled with anxiety. Their worries for their loved ones' safety had disrupted their daily lives.\n\nUnfortunately, interference in the Tacet Fields hindered real-time communication with soldiers. In response, Jinhsi implemented a speedy delivery service in collaboration with the Ministry of Development and Lollo Logistics. Free letters were quickly delivered to families of soldiers, thanks to Lollo Logistics, while the Ministry of Development built shortcuts for efficient transport. This helped ease the worries of families wanting updates on their loved ones serving in the military.\n\nAnother pressing issue Jinhsi tackled was comforting families who lost loved ones in battle. She worked with the Ministry of War and Ministry of Development to create a thorough plan. \n\nThe city honored fallen soldiers by increasing compensation for their families and building a wall of remembrance in Knell Square. Tablets bearing their names were made from the finest ore, able to withstand the elements and provide solace for centuries to come. The Midnight Rangers may not have fought for honor, but their sacrifices deserved to be remembered. With the completion of Knell Square, people had another place to commemorate and seek comfort in their loss.\n\nIn all these efforts to console and address the aftermath, Jinhsi always led by example. Whenever people saw her gentle smile, they knew she would introduce policies that cheered them up just like her smile did. Such warmth served as a balm for the wounds of war, helping the people of Jinzhou endure difficult times."

        "title": "Her Rare Anger",
        "content": "Jinhsi possesses an exceptionally good temper; no matter the circumstances, she always maintains a graceful and gentle smile, and hardly anyone has ever seen her get angry. \n\n\"Does our magistrate even know how to get angry? She's always so calm, no matter what.\" \n\n\"Seriously, I've wondered about that too. How would she look when mad?\"\n\n\"I've seen it,\" replied Shi, a typically solitary miner who stays focused on his work.\n\nIt was an exceptionally bitter winter. The contractor, citing supposed excessive equipment usage, claimed a hefty sum from a mining project, leaving the miners with nothing to show for their labor.\n\nFresh from the aftermath of battles, chaos reigned. With the surge in demand for civil construction, the need for ores skyrocketed. However, the Ministry of Development's exploration equipment fell short, forcing them to resort to renting privately owned tools. However, the contractor proved to be a profiteer, reneging on payment when the time came. What's worse, as the president of the Chamber of Commerce, he wielded a monopoly over exploration equipment in the market and paid little heed to the officials. \n\nAfter a year of hard work, Shi had been counting on the payment to spend a joyous New Year with his family. But now, that simple wish seemed out of reach. Looking at his calloused, weathered hands, Shi recalled the words of his colleague, Debiao: \"…Honesty won't fill our pockets. Let's take action and get back what we deserve—our own hard-earned cash.\"\n\nUnder the cover of night, Shi and his fellow workers sneaked into the merchant's mansion. Pressing his ear against the door, Shi listened intently for any signs of movement, ready to seize the chance to burst in.\n\n\"Mr. Zhu, I'm here to deliver some news,\" a young girl's voice sounded from within, gentle yet tinged with an unsettling chill. \"You have been removed from the Chamber of Commerce, and your business license has been revoked. Henceforth, you are forbidden from engaging in any commercial activities in Jinzhou.\"\n\n\"Huh? That's funny. We're in Jinzhou, a city renowned for its adherence to the law. Since you're new to your role, dear Magistrate, I'll turn a blind eye to your ignorance. Let me tell you: expelling a Chamber of Commerce president takes a minimum of two weeks here, and as for revoking my business license, I demand evidence! No evidence, no revocation. Simple as that.\"\n\n\"Since you mentioned the law, then let's discuss it. Per Article 180 of the Jinzhou Commercial Law, expelling a Chamber of Commerce president requires over half of its members' signatures, as well as those of the Minister of Commerce and Director of the Ministry of Development. Obtaining approval from the magistrate can be time-consuming. Therefore, I am here to inform you personally in order to expedite the return of wages for our workers.\"\n\n\"Regarding the evidence you requested… The Patrol Station has already collected and submitted it to the Decree Council. I am always prepared.\"\n\n\"As I leave, know that your monopoly on exploration gear has ended. The Ministry of Development expedited production and new equipment arrived today. Your monopoly was never going to last.\"\n\nLost in the noise inside, Shi missed the rest of the conversation. It seemed like someone was defending themselves, but Shi knew it would be useless against overwhelming proof and careful planning.\n\nSoon, they were notified of their rightful payment on their Terminals. Finally, they could ring in the New Year with happiness.\n\nFollowing that, such occurrences ceased as Magistrate Jinhsi enacted new laws prohibiting monopolies and amended payment settlement procedures: workers' wages are settled before contractors receive their payments.\n\nAs winter faded into spring, a new era dawned.\n\n\"C'mon Shi, spill the beans! What was the Magistrate like when she got angry?\"\n\n\"Well... She wasn't scary. She looked very dependable. Reassuring.\"\n\n\"What?!\""

        "content": "Many praise young Magistrate Jinhsi for her remarkable intelligence and perceptive nature. There seems to be no realm of knowledge beyond her grasp, nor any challenge she cannot surmount.\n\nSince taking office, she deftly navigates Jinzhou's complex affairs, implementing policies that have brought about peace and prosperity for its people, ushering in an era of peace and prosperity.\n\nAs the Magistrate of Jinzhou, Jinhsi's responsibilities extend from matters of great importance, such as military and political affairs, to seemingly minor issues. However, she believes that even the smallest details can greatly impact people's lives. This is the standard she holds herself to.\n\nThough well-informed, Jinhsi still faced mysteries unknown to her. Lately, a person of great significance to her city had arrived, surrounded by elusive secrets. This only piqued her curiosity and concern for them even more.\n\nAccording to historical records, a legendary hero in Jinzhou was said to possess the power of absorbing Tacet Discords with their bare hands. This person left an unforgettable mark on the history of Jinzhou and even the entire Huanglong region. Now, a new individual with unique abilities was about to appear in the world. Jinhsi suspected they may be connected to the fabled hero. Knowing the significance of this distinguished guest, Jinhsi planned a careful welcome, fully aware that they would be drawn into conflicts and conspiracies. Thus, she crafted a meticulous plan to greet them in her own distinctive manner.\n\nShe recorded a message to be broadcast throughout the region, extending a warm welcome to all visitors to Jinzhou, ensuring they felt warmly welcomed. She then purposefully left tokens to find her awaited guest, and to uncover hidden threats in the shadows.\n\nWorried about her distinguished guest's safety, she sent her personal bodyguard to protect them in secret. Mobilizing all available resources, she provided just the right amount of assistance to help her guest unravel one puzzle after another. Jinhsi remained determined to return to Jinzhou in time for their three-day agreement, despite hardships.\n\nOnce a serene haven, Mt. Firmament bristled with instability, its tranquility disrupted by the Sentinel's peril and minions of the Fractsidus. Driven by a desire for Jinzhou's peace, the young magistrate ventured alone into the fray, confronting various difficulties while seeking information about the Sentinel. \n\nEmerging unharmed from such adversity was challenging for even someone as strong-willed as Jinhsi. But whenever she felt discouraged or lost in self-doubt, she'd remember a certain person. Upon waking up, that individual swiftly grasped the intricate circumstances, exhibiting patience as they awaited her decision. Jinhsi was sure they would lead Jinzhou to a brighter future, together.\n\nOn the City Hall's terrace, Jinhsi, the returning magistrate, gazed at esteemed guest with relief and joy. With a nod of greeting, she uttered the words she had rehearsed a thousand times over:\n\n\"It's been three days.\"\n\n\"We've both made it on time.\"\n\n\"Allow me to formally introduce myself. I am Jinhsi... It brings me great joy to see you, Rover.\""

        "title": "An Interview",
        "content": "Years later, I found myself standing at that door again.\n\nThe Xiangli family had always been a star in Jinzhou's journalistic circles. Back then, doing a piece on the family was considered an honor, and indeed, their scientific heritage continues to produce admirable accomplishments. The last time I stood on this doorstep, I was still a rookie, eager for recognition, and the Xianglis helped me with just that by allowing me to take their family portrait. A piece that ticked all the boxes.\n\nThe photo won me a small award and secured my job.\n\nAs the door opened, I looked down to see a boy with bright and clear eyes looking back at me. I flashed my press badge, and he ushered me inside.\n\nXiangli Yao, the \"Son of the Genius\" and \"Paragon's Descendant.\" His father's brilliance had turned heads across Jinzhou, and his mother's perseverance saved the lives of countless children in the city.\n\nThis very house once drew the attention of many, and it remains that way to this day.\n\nI prided myself on conducting interviews, but this young boy seemed more comfortable than I was. Xiangli Yao, like his parents, possessed a natural eloquence, his demeanor gentle and poised. The interview flowed smoothly, and after setting aside my notebook, he offered me a cup of tea. I thanked him, but he shook his head.\n\n\"I should thank you for visiting because of my parents,\" Xiangli Yao smiled, \"I've heard a thing or two about what's been happening.\"\n\nJinzhou, with its vast lands and rich resources, is not without its share of discord.\n\nThe Xianglis had done me a favor in the past, one I felt compelled to repay, both professionally and personally by making sure their son was okay. Xiangli Yao smiled wistfully, his expression hinting at a memory relived. \"My parents are always busy with work, so I'm glad someone remembers them. Your reports capture their moments, research results, words spoken, and many other details that I didn't even know about... When I read those news and interviews, I feel like I get to know them better.\"\n\nI hesitated for a moment but still went on to ask.\n\n\"Do you think... it's unfair? That perhaps your parents should have spent more time with their child?\"\n\n\"They both have their passions, and it's the same for me. I'm happy they're doing what they love.\"\n\n\"...Is that so.\"\n\nI took a deep breath and prepared to leave, but Xiangli Yao asked me to stay. I forgot the exact reason he gave. However, I'm sure it must've been a good one. Xiangli Yao had a way with words that made refusing his hospitality difficult. I only remember having another cup of warm tea and continuing to chat for a while before finally taking my leave.\n\nAs I reached for the door, the boy remarked with a straight face, \"If there's anything you want to confirm, it's best to do it in person. When I was little, my mother and I often talked about the importance of companionship—we even exchanged small notes. Though I was still very young then, those notes, with their few simple words... I find them just as comforting today.\"\n\nI nodded and left the house, ready to pen my next piece.\n\nBut before that, I would send a message to my child, whom I had neglected to contact for several days."

        "title": "A Persuasion",
        "content": "Xiangli Yao leaned forward in his chair and stared resolutely at the elderly man in front of him.\n\nThe older man held a prestigious position in the education system and had personal connections with Xiangli Yao's father. Today, it was another attempt at persuasion, much like the previous ones.\n\n\"I am not attending a separate class. Regular school is fine for me,\" Xiangli Yao reiterated.\nThe elderly man tapped on the table, \"Your current pace might not fit into the standard curriculum. Moving too quickly can bring challenges. You and your classmates are not on the same playing field.\"\n\nXiangli Yao shook his head.\n\n\"There's no point wasting resources opening a special class just for me. I already have access to the Jinzhou archives for study. Besides... I'm just like the others,\" he said, counting on his fingers, \"I have a great time watching hero plays with them, and we trade cards... Oh, and when they invite me over for dinner, I get to test my gadgets out on them and get their feedback!\"\n\nThe elder sighed deeply. \"Your teacher has mentioned such things to me. He says you get along well with your classmates. But this isn't just about you, it's about getting you into the Academy faster,\" he said, staring at the young person before him. \"Xiangli Yao, your father also accelerated his studies and had more time to conduct all the research he loved.\"\n\n\"I am not my father.\"\n\n\"Yet you share his talents and temperament. That I've noticed.\"\n\nXiangli Yao gripped the textbooks in his hands, as he slowly and firmly shook his head, \"But that's not what I want. I want to take things slow, like the way it is now.\"\n\n\"Playing trivial games with your classmates won't do you any good... You'll tire of it sooner or later. It's a waste of time.\"\n\nThe elder stood by the window, looking out at students playing and laughing in the schoolyard. Xiangli Yao went to him, patting his shoulder.\n\n\"That won't happen,\" Xiangli Yao said softly, also looking at the same view. \n\nThey were his friends.\n\n\"I want to be like them, going to school, talking about snacks, catching fish in the river, and watching cool Echoes. Hey, they even taught me when and how to smile and compliment someone. That's important to me. I know you mean well, but... I get to decide what's best for me, right?\"\n\nOld and young faced each other in the silent office.\n\nThe elder sighed again. \"You remind me of your father. But the two of you are not quite the same.\"\n\nXiangli Yao smiled, \"Well, like I said... I'm not my father. I'm not the student you once had.\"\n\nThe door opened again.\n \nThe next day, Xiangli Yao returned to his regular classes."

        "content": "\"Here. Another package of yours.\"\n\nHis friend placed the box in a forgotten corner of the dorm, then sprawled out in bed, \"Xiangli Yao, you should definitely sign up for Lollo Logistics membership. With how often you've been getting these deliveries, it's worth it.\"\n\nXiangli Yao turned his chair to face his friend, \"Haha. I'll think about it.\"\n\n\"Latest issue?\"\n\n\"Yeah, they sent me a sample.\"\n\n\"Jealous! I wish I could work that fast, popping out articles left and right while taking classes at the same time. Man.\" He waved his arms and grinned, \"I guess you already have that Imperial Academy exam in the bag. So, where's it gonna be?\"\n\nWith that, he tossed over a can of soda.\n\nThe can drew a perfect arc in the air, landing squarely in Xiangli Yao's hand.\n\n\"Too much sugar,\" sighed the model student, known for his healthy habits as his lips quirked into a smile, cracking open the can anyway. \"About that...\"\n\nA brief silence followed. Then Xiangli shook his head softly. \"I haven't decided yet.\"\n\nHis friend raised an eyebrow, surprised. \"Well, that's new. I thought you made up your mind already. Professors must be fighting over you.\" \n\n\"There are a few things I haven't figured out yet.\"\n\n\"Which are...?\"\n\n\"Boundaries. The boundaries of truth,\" Xiangli Yao said slowly, twisting a cube in his hands. \"Pascar, do you suppose that humanity will hold itself back in pursuing the boundaries of truth?\"\n\n\"Maybe. There are plenty of nut job scientists out there, so who knows.\"\n\n\"We chase after the stars, only to fall beneath them. Boundaries limit our scope... but without it, there's no way to tell whether you're progressing.\"\n\n\"Well... you and I have different opinions on this, and I'll keep mine to myself to avoid an argument. But what's all this got to do with your admission? You trying to change the subject on me?\"\n\nXiangli Yao smiled softly. \"It does. After my father pursued his own path, I've heard little about him. But I've uncovered some leads... Perhaps they'll lead me to the Court of Savantae, the place he went searching for.\"\n\n\"You sure you're going? After so many years, plenty of people have tried to find even a smither of hint related to the CSC, with little success.\"\n\n\"I feel that I must go. Even if I'll end up finding nothing. I want to know...\" \n\nThe young scholar spoke slowly, his voice gradually softened, \"I want to know... if my father crossed that boundary.\"\n \nA month before exams, Xiangli vanished.\n\nHe left behind a video, revealing his confusion and the sense of emptiness he felt on his path of pursuing the truth. But whichever path he chose henceforth, he would embrace its outcome.\n\nEmpty seats lingered in the dorm, as life carried on."

        "title": "A Ruin",
        "content": "It took over ten days to get inside the ruins.\n\nAt every step, remnants of the Court of Savantae's defenses were giving Xiangli Yao a hard time. Despite his meticulous preparations, some supplies and provisions had been lost along the way.\n\nXiangli Yao assessed what remained, weighing his options, and ultimately chose to press deeper into the ruins.\n\nHe had long since departed from the borders of Huanglong, and returning a second time to explore further would prove highly difficult. After surveying the soil upon arrival, the young scholar conjectured that these ruins, like those before, had little time left.\n\nInternally, however, conditions were far better. The bulk of the instruments were well-preserved and intact. Cerulean fluids surged and circulated in the conduits of all the mechanisms with a vitality outlasting their creators. Each mechanism, precise, robust, and elegant, was meticulously cataloged by Xiangli Yao as he discerned subtle deviations from Huanglong's existing technologies.\n\nThe more he explored, the more an irrepressible thrill seized him. Like a poet enraptured by fine wine, Xiangli Yao felt drunk on the outpouring of knowledge that surrounded him.\n\nHis Terminal had lost its connection to the outside world, but he still did his best to record everything. His fascination with mechanics, a domain where Savantae had made unparalleled strides, led him to wonder whether his father had known of these innovations, and where he was now on the path of chasing the stars.\n\nYet amid the marvels, signs of a strange intrusion became apparent. Ever since the Lament, most technologies should have reverted back to their rudimentary states. But here, structures once familiar bore alien marks of alteration, defying erosion yet imbued with an elegance surpassing even Savantae's other creations.\n\nThe deeper Xiangli Yao went into the ruins, the anomalies intensified. Xiangli Yao's recordings slowed. The need to distinguish between anomalies and original designs demanded meticulous care. Eventually, he landed on a guess: The people here were trying to create some sort of door.\n\nA door. A gateway. A... portal.\n\nFor the first time, Xiangli Yao hesitated.\n\nBesides the danger, the doubt was about direction. So far, no alternate passage into the ruins had revealed itself, suggesting his father's departure had taken a different path. Had his father fallen here? Or...\n\nIf truth had a path, perhaps this was its nearest gateway."

        "title": "A Smile",
        "content": "Later, when Xiangli Yao reflected on his journey through the Court of Savantae ruins, he realized that parts of his memory had become foggy. He suspected it was due to the effects of the ancient mechanisms and force fields—devices that transcended current technological limits and boasted near-unfathomable levels of advancement. Creating them was clearly unwise, at least for the CSC researchers. Since the Lament, exploration beyond had halted due to the warping of the laws of physics. Yet, many scholars still yearned to traverse the skies again and explore interstellar space.\n\nThat portal might have been built for that very purpose: to leap into the sky, or perhaps even further, into the heart of the civilization that had transformed these ruins.\n\nXiangli Yao wasn't sure if they had succeeded, but he paid a steep price for his curiosity—his arm. He could only speculate that he had managed to solve the sequence and activate the mechanism. He recalled the marks etched into the enormous cavity. They were rugged and twisted, as if a huge Tacet mark was carved onto it.\n\nThen, crystalline, delicate butterflies emerged from the fracture. A strange power seeped from the gap, glowing with the mysteries of another civilization. As Xiangli Yao stared into it, past barriers that once seemed insurmountable now appeared solvable within this new framework. The waves of knowledge surged, capable of bending, subduing, and intertwining all frequencies in existence.\n\nHe took a step forward, almost forgetting the blood gushing from his torn flesh. The dizziness from blood loss and a faint euphoria blurred his senses.\n\nAt that moment, he noticed a familiar object lying dust-covered on the workstation. His childhood memories were hazy, but he recognized it immediately as a gift from his mother to his father. Xiangli Yan had once shown it to him as a child, a father and son photo of them together. Suddenly, he understood. Even at the end, his father held onto a memory of their family. He hadn't abandoned everything.\n\nBeyond that threshold, could he still see himself progressing, at the end of pure theory where no one could observe…?\n\nHis father devoted everything to theoretical science, his mother to applied science. Xiangli Yao was like them, always longing to reach for the stars, even willing to burn himself in the process.\n\nThey had given their all.\n\nAnd what about him?\n\nStanding just a step away from the ultimate answer, the young scholar found himself thinking about trivial, unrelated things. He recalled how, after his parents' departure, friends and neighbors had dragged him out to join a Jinzhou festival. It was supposed to be the Moon-Chasing Festival, but the threat from the Threnodian had forced a simpler celebration. Yet, a festival is always a festival, a reminder to celebrate even in hard times. He had demonstrated one of his newest creations, a small gadget, which won applause from the crowd.\n\nHe was like his parents.\n\nHowever, he was not their clone. Even as his shadow followed theirs, he found himself unable to journey the same roads they had traveled.\n\nWith trembling hands, the young scholar searched for scattered parts, trying to assemble a device to stop the bleeding. His newly acquired Forte gently surged and began to warp the metal structures according to his will.\n\nAs the bleeding ceased, so did the grand opportunity before him.\n\nIt was only a few steps away... but Xiangli Yao had already turned his back.\n\nHe knew he had found his own answer."

A teenager at the time, he stood at a crossroads, uncertain whether to follow in his parents' footsteps or forge his own path. However, a year later, his heart led him down a path entirely different from theirs...\n\nOn his first day as a researcher, Xiangli Yao placed his ID card neatly on his desk, opened the window, and let the bustling sounds of Jinzhou City drift in.\n\n\"Huaxu Academy.

      "doc": "Evaluation Basis: [Resonance Assessment 2326-G]\n\nThe precise timing of Resonator Changli's Awakening remains uncertain. Reports indicate that Resonator Changli displayed early signs of fire manipulation during her childhood, often struggling to control it. However, as Changli matured into adulthood, the frequency and stability of these manifestations notably improved.\n\nResonator Changli's Tacet Mark is situated on her lower chest. Post-Awakening examinations have identified specific alterations in her physical attributes. These include a gradual fading of hair color at the tips and feather-like burn marks on her left arm, emitting a fiery glow influenced by her Forte.\n\nThe Resonance Spectrum Pattern of Changli mirrors the characteristics of fire, displaying a robust Syntony reaction in testing. Despite the exact trigger for her Awakening remaining uncertain, no other sample with a Resonance Spectrum Pattern similarity exceeding 60% has been identified. Resonator Changli's Forte aligns closely with the mythical spirit bird from Huanglong folklore, possibly influenced by her early immersion in tales related to this legendary creature.\n\nResonator Changli possesses the unique ability to compress flames into delicate feather-shaped projectiles. Her Forte, once unleashed, has the power to create scorching fires of exceptional heat, capable of devastating a large area. A telltale sign that her Forte is active is the emergence of a lone fiery feather with an eye-like pattern on her forehead, which she describes as the \"Mind's Eye.\"\n\nAnalysis of test samples has revealed a non-convergent Rabelle's Curve with a stable rise. Occasional fluctuations within normal range have been detected. Therefore, Changli is identified as a Natural Resonator.",
      "certification": "Resonator Changli's waveform graph shows elliptical fluctuations. The pattern of Time Domain is stable, with no abnormal waveform.\n\nResonant Criticality: High. Resonator Changli's frequency displays high stability, and the risk of Overclocking is minimal.\nResonator Changli has a documented history of Overclocking. \nMaximum recorded Overclocking rating: Negligible.\n\nAccording to Changli's report, she experienced Overclocking during her childhood due to prolonged exposure to a hazardous environment. This caused her Forte to go into an explosive state multiple times for self-preservation or the protection of others, resulting in a permanent burn mark on her left arm. \n\nHowever, as she grew up and gained more control over her Forte, the frequency fluctuation stabilized and the burn mark did not worsen. There may be irreversible physical damage from the Forte burst, which could potentially shorten Resonator Changli's lifespan. \n\nRegular physical check-ups are recommended, while psychological counseling is not currently necessary."

        "content": "People who visit the City Hall lately rarely see the legendary Counselor, Changli, as they would report.\n\nAlthough Counselor Changli never has been a public figure, as the most trusted aide to the Jinzhou Magistrate, she is known to everyone in Jinzhou. However, there are varied and strange restless rumors about her. \n\nIt is said that Counselor Changli, during her time in the capital, proposed the renovation of the Shelter Homes across Huanglong to provide a better home for the refugees who lost their homes in the Lament's aftermath; she also pushed for the reduction of commercial taxes in Jinzhou and allocate food and funds to better relieve Jinzhou from the aftermaths of the Battle Beneath the Crescent. \n\nIt is said that as soon as Counselor Changli arrived at the City Hall, she effortlessly resolved two bandit forces that had been entrenched around Jinzhou for a long time. Just a conversation and an \"obvious trap\" were enough to make the two forces suspicious of and fight each other until none was a threat anymore. \n\nIt is said that Counselor Changli did not become a Counselor after the Sentinel chose the Jinzhou Magistrate, but she had long volunteered to come to Jinzhou, to teach the young Jinhsi, and to help her take over the power that was too heavy for a child.\n\n\"Is that true? The version I heard said those were actions carried out by the previous Secretary-General, and she was only demoted to the border because she offended the power that was, right?\" \n\n\"Well, from what I heard, she became a direct disciple of Master Xuanmiao and was recommended by the previous Secretary-General. Her orations and debates throughout the realm have convinced all the great minds of our country. How could she be a flatterer?\" \n\n\"What are you talking about? I heard she is the descendant of a great hermit, and she came to Jinzhou because her family needs a voice in the power centers...\"\n\nAs people gossiped about her, Changli remained unfazed. When she passed by those whispering behind her back, her gaze gently but firmly silenced their words.\n\nRumors spread like wildfire about the new Jinzhou Magistrate, chosen by the Sentinel. A young girl, seemingly not yet of age, held this powerful position. Some whispered that Changli had too much influence and sought to overthrow the current Magistrate before taking over herself.\n\nAfter the ceremony, Changli gave up power to Jinhsi and became her Counselor. In three years, life improved for everyone in Jinzhou, and they were grateful to the Magistrate. However, nobody knew how much Changli helped behind the scenes.\n\nThose who have met Changli all say that she always has a gentle smile, and treats everyone from generals to soldiers equally, but when she is alone, she always has a kind of awe-inspiring aura that turns potential visitors away.\n\n\"Last time I met Counselor Changli at the Patrol Station, she seemed super interested in the courtyard trees, for some reason... I thought she had important duties to attend to, but she just spent a whole afternoon... watching ants...\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"Then a wanted suspect suddenly turned himself in! We were initially wary, thinking it was a trap. But when Counselor Changli appeared, the villain became visibly frightened and confessed everything, even old cases that were still unsolved. It was the biggest case of my career...\"\n\n\"What about Counselor Changli?\"\n\n\"She left at some point. We didn't even notice. Hmm, she really is an inscrutable person...\""

        "content": "Before becoming Jinhsi's tutor, Changli had only met her once when she was a young girl.\n\nWhile in Jinzhou, Changli once heard chanting from a nearby room while walking inside the City Hall. A young girl sat amidst stacks of books, struggling to grasp theories beyond her years. \n\n\"'He who can't see the cause of order or chaos shall not make law'... But how can I see the very roots of everything? How can I gain such insights?\" While she chanted, the girl could not help but fall muddled. \n\nThat hard-working, petite figure reminded Changli of how she used to struggle in a similarly desperate way to swallow as much knowledge as possible, trying to become an adult she wasn't.\n\nShe followed the impulse to lean forward and answered the little girl's doubt.\n\n\"Thank you, madam. You have enlightened me,\" the girl expressed her gratitude word by word, with her immature voice. After a moment of careful hesitation, she looked up again and asked, \"Then, how should I become a good Magistrate, and bring order to this city?\"\n\n\"Why this question?\"\n\n\"The people of Jinzhou have long fallen victim to warfare. I want to bring them peace and prosperity.\"\n\n\"...That is no easy task.\"\n\n\"True, but I must try everything I can.\"\n\n\"Peace and Prosperity\"...\n\nAs Changli gazed into the girl's eyes, she saw determination and strength, like little sparkles of starlight.\n\n\"Very well. Then I will aid you in fulfilling your wish,\" she declared.\n\nEventually, the girl became the Magistrate of Jinzhou, appointed by its Sentinel. As Jinhsi works tirelessly at City Hall, Changli remains by her side, answering questions and offering advice whenever needed.\n\nTo most, heroic tales are too grand and inconsequential. They only value simple comforts like a warm meal and restful sleep as ways to improve life.\n\n\"A Magistrate shouldn't get lost in bureaucracy, but rather engage with the people,\" Changli warned Jinhsi.\n\n\"Yes, my teacher,\" Jinhsi obeyed. Through the traditional Jinzhou wish-making rituals, Jinhsi managed to build connection with the citizens and worked towards a thriving, empathetic city.\n\nChangli watches as Jinhsi is crowded by excited people, whose faces are no longer covered by gloom and fatigue, but true delight and gratitude.\n\nNow that a wise governor has emerged in Jinzhou, neither the people nor the capital would doubt Jinhsi's competency.\n\n\"Do as you wish, I will support you,\" Changli said as she sowed seeds of knowledge and lit up Jinhsi's path ahead. The torch set the sky ablaze, illuminating the future of this young girl.\n\nDespite Jinhsi's lingering childishness, she knew this girl would one day become a capable Magistrate, protecting every inch of Jinzhou. Just as her master had done for her, she would guide her student and light the way forward."

        "title": "Lone Feather in the Alley",
        "content": "The owner of Yanqing Bookstore, Changqing, recently encountered two strange incidents.\n\nThe first involves his business.\n\nWith so many to be offered from the vast and rich land of Huanglong, items popular in Jinzhou are never there to stay. Recently, paper books have fallen out of fashion and the local bookstore has suffered. \n\nHowever, business has unexpectedly picked up in the past few days, and Changqing's bookstore has seen an influx of customers.\n\nMany of the customers at the bookstore appeared to be officials from the Central Court, judging by their attire. \n\nWhen a puzzled Changqing asked them about it, most mentioned that the Secretary-General had recommended this particular place. \n\nThe Secretary-General? Although he knew there was a new Secretary-General in office, Changqing couldn't fathom why someone like him, a humble bookstore owner, would be tied to such high-ranking individuals.\n\nThe second strange incident revolves around the neglected facade of Yanqing Bookstore.\n\nUnder the weight of depression, it had been left unattended for too long. Even the grocer next door advised Changqing to repair the gate before it deterred potential customers.\n\n\"Changqing, you should fix your gate. If it gets worse, no one will ever visit your store!\" \n\n\"Don't worry. Although my store may not be as fancy as those in the capital, I have the greatest collection of antique and classic texts. People will surely find out!\"\n\nWhile he might have appeared confident, Changqing was uncertain about renovating the old store himself. He considered hiring someone during the current boom in business.\n\nThe next day, he arrived at the store to find that the facade had miraculously transformed overnight. The plaque and gate were gleaming, proudly displaying \"Yanqing Bookstore.\"\n\nA note on the counter read, \"In gratitude for the bookstore owner's kindness, I took the liberty to do some renovation work as a thank you gesture.\"\n\nThe note was not signed, but the vermilion-colored feather pattern on the paper seemed somewhat familiar. Changqing held the note and slowly sat down, falling into memory. \n\nMore than decade ago, the bookstore was thriving with customers coming and going. One day, a little girl around eight or nine years old started sneaking in and spending whole afternoons reading books.\n\nInitially, Changqing didn't mind when customers read without purchasing as long as it didn't damage the books or affect business.\n\nBut after several days of declining sales and fewer customers, he grew concerned.\n\n\"So hot. It's too hot in here! I can't stand it anymore. Let's go somewhere else!\" \n\nDespite the early autumn weather, the room was unusually sultry. Changqing wiped his forehead and searched carefully, eventually finding a little girl curled up under a bookshelf, completely engrossed in her book.\n\nIn front of her, a fire was floating, heating up the whole premise as the girl was absorbed into the world of the books. This sight filled Changqing with rage.\n\n\"What are you doing, kid? You're burning my store!\"\n\nThe girl was startled by a shout, immediately snuffing out the fire. Changqing watched as the page she held tightly turned yellow, as if it would catch fire soon.\n\n\"You, you are...!\"\n\nThe girl hurriedly threw the book away. Her flushed face revealed a mix of panic and guilt as she surveyed the charred pages.\n\n\"Sorry, it's too dark here, I just wanted to make it brighter...\" \n\nAs Changqing saw his beloved book being damaged, he couldn't help but remember the recent decline in sales. His face darkened as he grabbed a broom from the side of the bookshelf and prepared to strike the girl responsible.\n\nHowever, she was surprisingly quick for her slender frame. When Changqing pursued her out of the bookstore, all he could see was her fiery red hair disappearing in the bustling market. He stood at the gate, fuming and bewildered.\n\n\"Never show your face again!\"\n\n\"What's wrong?\" The grocer next door came out with a smile and asked, \"Isn't that the little girl who can control fire?\" \n\n\"You know her? She almost burned down my store!\" \n\n\"Hey, she's a good girl, I kid you not. Helped me out a few days ago, just to get some steamed buns. It's a pity she had to walk here alone, so young and all. I heard her hometown was attacked by the TD Outbreak and no one made it. Not sure how she managed to escape...\"\n\n\"Why didn't you tell me earlier?\"\n\n\"Well, you didn't ask! But now that this happened... she probably won't come back again.\" \n\nThe little girl disappeared down the alley, and sounds of children playing drifted over from the neighboring walls. Changqing gazed at the book lying on the ground, unsure of what to feel."

I swear, I earned it! Sorry for the books I burned... Only you have the books I'm looking for. Please, may I...\" \n\nThe girl bit her lip, timidly placing the scattered Shell Credits from her hands on the counter. Her petite figure was not even as tall as the counter, so only half of her head was visible. She was on her tiptoes, her body slightly trembling, but her bright, somewhat stubborn eyes were still fixed on him, and wouldn't evade.\n\n\"...Alright.\"\n\nAfter all the days, Changqing's anger had long since subsided. He waved his hand, \"Go, take your money, and don't disturb my business.\"\n\nThe girl bowed and left without a word. She kept stopping and looking back as she walked away. Changqing sighed heavily, watching her frail figure and worn-out clothes in silence. He rose, grabbed a lamp, and gave it to the girl with the store's spare key. \n\n\"Take it. Don't use fire for light anymore. Come read at night when there's no customers.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"I'm not letting you read for free. You'll need to open the shop for me in the morning.\" \n\n\"T-thank you, sir...\" \n\nIt was his first glimpse of the girl's innocent, beaming smile.\n\nAfter their initial encounter, the girl became a regular at Changqing Bookstore. As arranged, she would only come in the evenings and spend her time solely absorbed in reading. In the mornings, when Changqing returned, he always found the store immaculately clean and organized.\n\nDuring colder days, the girl also visited during daylight hours. Despite the wintry gusts outside, the room was filled with a cozy warmth. Though Changqing occasionally glimpsed at her reading material, he could only make out books on literature and history.\n\nThe girl's calm demeanor belied her youth, only animated when lost in her books.\n\nOne day, the girl vanished. Rumors spread—was she taken by Tacet Discords? Or did she succumb to injuries on her journey to the capital city? \n\nSeeing the flame pattern on the letter, Changqing felt a spark of hope. Could she still be alive?\n\n\"Excuse me?\" \n\nChangqing's reminiscing was interrupted by a tall, elegant lady standing at the counter. Her soft eyes and flame-colored hair, like a mythical bird's feathers, gently swayed in the wind. She placed some Shell Credits on the counter and asked with a smile, \"Sir, only you have the books I'm looking for. Please, may I borrow them?\"\n\nShe had transformed from a delicate girl to a confident young Secretary-General, the talk of the town. As the sun rose and filled the room with morning light, the aged bookshop owner chuckled and gestured for her to continue reading. \n\n\"Go on… Read it, even if you don't pay. I doubt I can force you to now.\""

Though he was initially reluctant to mentor another student, the revered elder dedicated himself to passing on every ounce of wisdom to her in their limited time together.\n\nMaster Xuanmiao was a devoted Weiqi player. During breaks on their weary journey, they would settle by the roadside to engage in intense matches. He utilized these moments not just for play but also as teaching opportunities for Changli, imparting wisdom on strategic thinking and power dynamics within each move. Sometimes, he would analyze an unfinished game of Weiqi with her, but he always seemed somewhat dissatisfied with her responses. \n\nIt was during these times that he would mention an old friend of his, hinting at a quest to reconnect with this individual through Changli's tutelage. Despite Changli's curiosity about this mysterious person's identity and location, her mentor would simply shake his head and tell her, \"The time has not yet come.\"\n\nOn the day he felt his final moments approaching, he entrusted Changli with his Weiqi game record and his cherished journal. With solemnity, he told his devoted disciple, \"In this unfinished game, you shall find the ultimate truth.\" \n\nAnd so, carrying on the legacy of Master Xuanmiao, Changli embarked on her path ahead.\n\n\"...A celestial being descended, wielding the limitless might of the universe, embracing the inaugural Echo within...\"\n\"...The enigmatic figure with eyes of gold amidst swirling clouds and waning lights.\"\n\"...Steadfastly by the side of Sentinel Jué, in a bond of intimate camaraderie.\"\n\nFollowing the notes in her late mentor's journal, she continued her search, uncovering traces of that enigmatic figure in various unexpected places. At times, it was the captivating tales spun by seasoned storytellers; elsewhere, it was mere slivers gleaned from ancient archives. Like a silent guardian, this person acted as a sturdy anchor in turbulent seas, leading humanity through the wreckage of past calamities towards a hopeful horizon. The subtle imprints they left behind wove an almost imperceptible yet unyielding thread that bridged vast stretches of time and history far surpassing the ordinary span of mortal lives.\n\nShe had been told that the signs of that person's arrival would be impossible to miss. That said person had the power to truly change the world. However, her vision of a peaceful and prosperous world required more than mere hopeful anticipation of a savior. Understanding that achieving her dreams necessitated acquiring substantial power and influence, she embarked on a journey through diverse lands, immersing herself in wisdom, and persisting through every challenge without faltering to meet the expectations placed upon her.\n\nUpon assuming the esteemed role of Secretary-General, she at last gained entry into the revered Grand Libraries. Within the vast expanse of knowledge stored within their walls, she uncovered a pivotal revelation: a clue leading her to Jinzhou, a border city in Huanglong.\n\nFrom then on, everything unfolded precisely as Sentinel Jué predicted. The person she had been searching for emerged in Jinzhou and protected the city from a reviving Threnodian. The once nebulous being from ancient records and myths now solidified into a clear and distinct presence within her mind.\n\nOn the day of their foretold encounter, she returned to Jinzhou from Mingting, the capital city of Huanglong. She witnessed the esteemed guest of Jinzhou waiting at the ferry port in the rain, looking uncertain.\n\nFollowing the prophecies of Jué, she had faith that their paths would converge at the right moment. \nAnd that awaited moment was upon her. \n\nConcealing a whirlwind of emotions behind her gaze, she advanced towards them with measured steps. Using her paper umbrella adorned with a spirit bird motif, she gently angled it to provide cover from the rain, as their eyes locked in a wordless exchange. The sole audible presence was the hushed melody of raindrops tapping against her umbrella.\n\nShe smiled and softly asked, \"Are you trapped here by the rain?\""

The woman, absorbed in selecting jewelry to wear, stole a fleeting glance at the artwork. \"Impressive, Zhezhi,\" she murmured with a brief smile. Delighted by the praise, the girl inched closer. \"The people in this one are—\" Her words faltered as her mother turned, absorbed in wardrobe choices, oblivious to her daughter's attempt at connection. \"Well done. Now, why don't you paint a few more before the guests arrive?\" Zhezhi blinked, at a loss for words. Her mother grew impatient, sighing as she marched Zhezhi to the door. \"Buy whatever supplies you need, dear. The price doesn't matter, we can afford it. Now, I need to dress. Be a good girl. Off you go.” As the door closed, Zhezhi stared at it, wanting to say more but unable to find the courage to voice the sinking feeling in her chest.\n\nLater that evening, Zhezhi, dressed to impress, nervously clutched her skirt in the corner seat, silent amidst the bustling room of guests. The woman noted Zhezhi's unease, the sight of it triggering memories of their family's past struggles and humble beginnings. She strode forward, taking Zhezhi's hand and leading her into the center of attention. \"Didn't you know? Zhezhi was gifted from the day she was born. Her paintings were chosen for exhibitions even before we hired a tutor.\" With a painted smile, she mimicked the grace of the upper class. \"Would you care for a painting too? Zhezhi can finish one in a day.\" Zhezhi shrank inwardly, wishing to disappear, only to be thrust forward. \"Show everyone your skills, Zhezhi.\" All eyes turned to her, leaving Zhezhi trembling, unable to paint a single stroke.\n\nLater, as the mansion fell silent, Zhezhi gathered her courage again. Holding the day's painting, she approached her parents' bedroom door. Just before knocking, she overheard their conversation inside.\n\"Did you know? That painting sold for 400,000 Credits today. With this money, we can fulfill the paused order.\"\n\"Right. Are the paintings for the guests ready for this weekend?\"\n\"Not yet. Zhezhi mentioned wanting to go to the theater. That girl, always seeking diversions, never thinking about what's best for this family...\"\n\nZhezhi looked down at the happy family in the painting, her grip tightening until it crumpled, distorting her mother and father's faces.\n\"...I'm sorry.\""

Glancing around to make sure she was alone, she stretched her arms, and for a moment, let go of her parents' demands.\n\nAs her bare feet met the grass, its prickly, cool softness awakened a sense of nature's healing vitality. She broke into an impulsive run, shedding worries about upholding the refined image her family demanded. A distant voice abruptly interrupted her frolic.\n\n\"Hey, who are you? What are you doing in our field?\"\n\nStartled, Zhezhi immediately looked down at her feet in embarrassment. Realizing she was trespassing on private property, she apologized as she tried to leave. \"I'm so sorry! I came here to paint. I didn't know this was someone's field...\"\n\nThe girl laughed, seeing the panic on Zhezhi's face. \"Don't worry! These veggies are tough. You don't need to run!\" She laughed as she continued gathering the vegetables with her sickle. \"A painter, huh? That's different...\" Zhezhi hesitated for a moment, seeing the girl hard at work. \"Let me help you with that...\" The girl met Zhezhi's eyes with a twinkle. \"Sure! Thanks for offerin'! Here, use this sickle, I'll go grab another one!\"\n\nZhezhi stared in confusion at the sickle promptly shoved into her hands. But she soon squatted down among the tall vegetables, mimicking the farm girl's movements. \"Wait, wait. You won't get anywhere doin' it like that. Here, lemme show ya!\"\n\nUnder the hot sun, the two girls worked together to harvest the field until they reached its end. Exhausted, they lay under a tree to rest. Zhezhi forgot about the mud on her shoes and the dirt on her expensive dress, lost in the joy of spending time with her new friend. The carefree laughter between them filled her heart with ease and brought a true smile to her lips.\n\nThe mood was suddenly cut by a sharp voice. Zhezhi turned to see her mother watching, her eyes squinted in anger. Zhezhi could see her disdain for her new friend. Sprinting to her feet, she ran to explain and apologize, transforming back into the child her parents demanded she be.\n\nA few days later, the girl received a scroll. She unrolled it carefully, gasping softly at the sight. The painting showed her and Zhezhi in the sprawling fields of her home, picking vegetables together.\n\nA letter fell from the painting.\n\n\"I'm sorry I didn't say goodbye. I had so much fun harvesting the field with you! The sickle, the sun beating down on us, my sore hands... It made me realize what my paintings were missing. This is my best work, and it's for you! I hope you like it! Maybe next week, I can sneak out to help again.\"\n\nReading the letter made the girl smile, but she couldn't help being confused by Zhezhi's last line.\n\nNext week? Did she think the vegetables would grow back that fast?"

She hesitated, taking a few steps back.\n\n\"Maybe I should go to another store...\" The thought had barely crossed her mind before she dismissed it. \"But... this is the only store with the latest supplies...\"\n\nZhezhi stopped her pacing and pulled out a coin, a habit she had developed for situations like this. She tossed it into the air, caught it, and thought to herself, \"The usual. Heads, I go in. Tails, I come back another time...\"\n\nShe slowly opened her palm, peeking briefly before quickly squeezing her hand shut. \"No, wait. Best two out of three.\"\n\nThe coin went up and came back down. \"Heads again,\" she sighed.\n\nClutching the coin tightly, Zhezhi took a deep breath and steeled herself. \"Oh well, I guess this is a sign. I can't keep running away.\"\n\nTaking a deep breath to gather her courage, she marched to the store and pushed the door open with all her might. The sharp ring of the bell above the door sent her nerves into overdrive. She rushed forward with a lowered gaze and blurted out the lines she'd rehearsed countless times, as if her tongue was on fire.\n\n\"H-Hello! I'd like to buy some new paint! Six cans of Malachite Green No.3, five cans of Azurite Blue No.3, five cans of Vermilion, three cans of Indigo, three cans of Ochre, three cans of Gamboge, and two cans of Golden Yellow. Thank you!\"\n\nRelieved to have finished her sentence smoothly without a single pause, Zhezhi inhaled deeply to catch her breath. When she looked up, she met the eyes of a surprised-looking clerk who was just coming out from the back room.\n\n\"Hello there. How can I help you?\" The clerk's gentle voice was a stark contrast to what Zhezhi had imagined.\n\nRealizing that her earlier words had gone unheard, she froze. \"Uhh... I...\"\n\n\"Are you looking for any specific art supplies?\"\n\n\"P-Paint... I...\"\n\n\"The new releases? They're quite popular.\"\n\n\"N-No... I think I...\"\n\n\"No rush. Feel free to look around.\"\n\nZhezhi, sweating and nervous, walked over to a shelf. \"O-Okay...\"\n\nThe clerk's detailed and professional introduction of the products gradually eased Zhezhi's nerves. She relaxed and was able to name what she wanted, even chatting about her painting.\n\n\"If you're using White Jade Paper, these new products would pair nicely.\"\n\n\"Perfect, that's just what I needed. I'll take these too.\"\n\nWalking out of the store with her new supplies, Zhezhi felt light and confident.\n\n\"I guess I can talk to people when I'm not feeling anxious. Next time... I'll try it without flipping the coin. Maybe it'll work out again...\""

As she gazed at the mess, it dawned on her that she herself was just another discarded item, abandoned by her parents like the rest.\n\nDesperate for shelter, she first sought out places familiar to her. But those once kind and welcoming turned cold when they learned of her plight. Behind their polite excuses, Zhezhi saw the distaste in their eyes as they pointed her to an old hotel on a street corner.\n\nThe hotel's decaying corridors teemed with unfamiliar fights and loud arguments. Sitting on the bed, she wrapped herself tightly in the musty covers, eyes fixed on the flimsy wooden door barricaded by a table. She longed for sleep, hoping to wake from this nightmare, yet fear kept her awake, afraid the door would shatter if she closed her eyes.\n\nHer descent from luxury to hardship stretched endlessly, each day a painful reminder. The staggering figures of her parents' debt seemed to flicker across the ceiling in the dim light of her windowless room. Her hands, covered in worn bandages, trembled from painting non-stop for two days, but she dared not rest.\n\n\"It's a big order... I can't mess this up,\" she murmured, her weary eyes blurring the landscapes on her canvas.\n\nSuddenly, harsh shouts pierced the night, jarring her awake from an unintended nap at her desk. She stumbled to the door, slipping on something wet at her feet.\n\nAching from the fall, she stood nervously at the door of her leaking room, apologizing repeatedly to her neighbors. The biting cold seeped through her wet clothes, and the neighbors' complaints echoed through the thin walls. She stared at her painting, ruined by the water, and a heavy sigh escaped her lips, compressing the room's thin air, almost crushing her fragile frame.\n\nZhezhi's exhausted figure stood motionless in the cold puddle. After a long pause, a faint light glowed in the cramped room. With paint-stained fingertips, she scrolled through her Terminal, \"First, shut off the water valve... then replace the damaged parts...\"\n\nShe had made a habit of looking up solutions for life's unexpected challenges. \n\n\"I think I've got it... I'll give it a try...\"\n\nShe waded through the water, slowly making her way to the source of the problem."

She wandered the streets with her bundle of paintings, feeling a sense of numbness begin to creep over her as the festive preparations around her started to fade into the background. It wasn't until she tripped, her paintings scattering, that she snapped out of her daze. Without bothering to look for her glasses, at first she scrambled to pick up her work. But as the wind blew some paintings out of reach, she stopped, staring for a moment before deciding to let them go.\n\n\"Forget it, they're lousy anyway... What's the point of having them back...\"\n\nShe dropped the remaining paintings in her arms, letting them fall. Lost in her thoughts, she didn't notice someone stopping in front of her.\n\nA stranger picked up her paintings and glasses, handing them back to her.\n\n\"Did you paint these? I've never seen art like that. Remarkable.\"\n\nZhezhi, stunned by the compliment, could only accept the outstretched paintings and watch the stranger turn and leave alongside their companions, disappearing into the night.\n\nShe fumbled to put on her glasses to catch a clearer glimpse of who it was, but all she caught was a distant silhouette.\n\n\"Someone complimented me... \"\n\"They had nothing to gain from it. It was just... simple praise for my paintings.\"\n\nThe stranger's words, simple yet sincere, pierced through her paintings to reach her heart. For the first time ever, it was as if someone saw her creative intentions. It was like a sudden beam of light scattering the dark clouds that had long weighed her down, bringing a sense of warmth long overdue.\n\nZhezhi stared in the direction the stranger had vanished, clutching her paintings tightly. Until...\n\n\"Excuse me... Hello?\"\n\nDays later, a familiar voice startled her out of her thoughts as she searched for the perfect spot to paint.\n\n\"Don't worry, we're just here to chat.\"\n\nZhezhi looked up and saw a pair of golden eyes. The memory of that night rushed back—this was the person who had complimented her work, their voice free of the pretense she had grown to despise from everyone else. That voice had given her strength when she had been ready to give it all up.\n\nThe warmth from that night returned, filling a world of pale grey with color once more."

        "content": "Outside an old house in Yuezhou lies a patch of reeds beside a lake. To the north, the water narrows; to the south, it widens, resembling a sliced pear, with the surface shimmering under the night sky.\n\nThe summer air hung thick with heat, lulling the world into a drowsy stupor.\n\nIn the quiet of the evening, Lumi nestled in her mother's arms on a rocking chair by the window. Her eyelids drooped as she gazed out sleepily. The soft breeze from a fan brushed her skin, making her squint with contentment. The chorus of insects filled the yard, and Lumi curled even closer to her mother, lulled by the comforting sounds of the village.\n \nThis small place was Changzhuang. No one could quite remember why it was called that, but they grew accustomed to this name over time. \n\nThe disasters following the Lament had spread across all of Huanglong. Even here, deep in the mountains of Yuezhou, they had left their indelible mark by cutting the village off from the outside world—technology crumbled, and the villagers returned to the old ways—farming, hunting, surviving as their ancestors once had. Life was dictated by the rising and setting sun. Over time, people in Changzhuang became used to the peace and simplicity of this lifestyle.\n\nThe day Lumi was born, the whole house lit up. The swaddled infant glowed softly, catching the eye of every villager. They gathered in the yard, curious to see the newborn who shone like a small beacon. Resonators were rare here, and ones like Lumi, with such innate power, were even rarer. But in a village as tranquil as Changzhuang, there were no grand challenges that even needed a child Resonator to solve. Therefore, Lumi grew up carefree, just like other ordinary children in the village. She learned the ways of the mountains and fields—how to track wild animal traces and how to distinguish which plants might sate a hungry belly.\n\nPeople in Changzhuang enjoyed cooling off under the shade of a tree. As Lumi ran through the trees with her friends, her inborn light flickered as if performing a cheerful dance. The village elders lovingly called her \"Sunshine,\" while her friends dubbed her \"Lumi the Firefly.\" Yet Lumi often wondered about her strange gift, unsure of its purpose. More often than not, it was a nuisance. On hunting trips, her light would flash uncontrollably, startling prey.\n\nAfter being asked to temporarily sit out from the hunts, Lumi's heart sank with a pang of frustration. Alone, she wandered to the marshes by the reeds and sat down. Her glow flickered, dimmed, and then brightened again as she practiced, trying to control the light. Finally, exhaustion set in, and she drifted off to sleep. Despite her struggles, Lumi never felt rushed. \n\nLife in Changzhuang was slow, and there was always time to grow and to learn. \n\nThe shimmering surface of the lake returned to darkness. The night breeze ferried the croaks of frogs away. Tomorrow was another day."

But Zhangzhang didn't come… She seems to have lost interest in this kind of thing...\"\n\nLumi paused and closed her notebook in the golden light of the setting sun.\n\nIt was a thick hardcover notebook—a birthday gift from her parents, one she had chosen herself. Once a diary, it had transformed into an exploration journal as she grew older. As a child, Lumi was content wandering the pebble paths of Changzhuang, but now, those paths felt too small. Her curiosity stretched beyond the borders of the village. She longed for the roads that led to the world outside. \n\nThe only problem was—no one had found those roads in a long, long time.\n\nHer father once told her about the many failed attempts. Over the years, many had tried to find a way beyond the mountains, but all had returned empty-handed, lost, or worse. Eventually, the villagers gave up, their focus shifting to more immediate concerns. Life in Changzhuang was demanding—farming from spring to autumn, then bracing for the long winter when the mountains would disappear under a blanket of silver frost, making exploration impossible.\n\nLumi understood the demands of life, yet her curiosity and yearning for adventure burned even brighter. She quickly gathered a group of friends and formed a small exploration team, determined to find a way out. But despite their excitement, failure kicked in—the aftermath of the Lament had seemingly twisted the terrain, eliminating every possible way out, just like it had their forebears.\n\nAt first, the setbacks didn't bother them. They were kids, after all, full of energy and hope. But as time passed, they drifted away. The older ones joined the labor teams, others lost interest. Lumi's once lively group dwindled, and today, her exploration ended earlier than planned as everyone was eager to hurry home before dusk settled in.\n\nLumi sighed. \n\nShe knew that for most of her friends, this was just a way to pass the time. \n\nShe stood up, cupped her hands around her mouth, and shouted toward the mountains, her voice echoing against the rocks and trees before fading into the evening air.\n\nThe sunset blazed across the sky, casting the horizon in shades of red and gold before melting into the soft kiss of the night. \n\nLumi smiled, patting her cheeks lightly. It didn't matter. The thrill of discovering something new, something unknown, still filled her with excitement.\n\n\"…Oh! I'll tell Zhangzhang all about the view when we meet for ice pops tonight. And Beihai, Ming…\"\n\nShe whispered the names of her friends as she waved goodbye to the mountains, then turned and made her way down the hill, alone but content."

Her hand instinctively gripped the container, and she eagerly gulped it down.\n\n\"Easy now, don't rush,\" the voice urged, gentle and concerned. \"You'll choke if you drink too fast.\"\n\nAs the last drop slipped down her throat, Lumi blinked, her mind finally clearing. She looked up at the faces of her rescuers—a small squad, three of them, dressed in similar clothing. Their leader, a girl with a kind smile, helped her sit up.\n\n\"Are you from around here? That's a surprise. We were told there's no one living in these parts,\" the girl said, a hint of curiosity in her voice. \"Guess we'll need to update our map.\"\n\n\"Thank you… for saving me,\" Lumi whispered, her words faltering. The world she knew was small, confined to the mountains and the narrow boundaries of Changzhuang. \"A-are you from the outside?\"\n\nThe squad exchanged glances, and it was then that Lumi noticed the emblem on their uniforms—a chubby hamster wearing a straw hat, grinning adorably.\n\nA hand reached out, helping Lumi to her feet. \n\n\"Sorry for the late introduction. We're from Lollo Logistics, a delivery squad.\"\n \nMonths later, Chengxiao smiled, setting down the comb and patting Lumi's shoulder. \n\n\"Take a look. How do you feel?\"\n\nLumi stared at her reflection, stunned by the unfamiliar face in the mirror. The girl staring back at her had neat curls and wore a clean, fitted Lollo Logistics uniform—looking every bit the city dweller she had become.\n\nChengxiao, the leader of the squad that had rescued her, had taken Lumi from the quiet of Changzhuang to the bustling city and taken her under her wing. She was quick-witted, reliable, and now Lumi's mentor at Lollo Logistics.\n\n\"I look… different,\" Lumi muttered, scratching her head shyly. \"Thank you, Chengxiao.\"\n\n\"None of that formality now,\" Chengxiao laughed. \"I'm off to deliver some documents. Cafeteria later?\"\n\n\"Sure!\"\n\nAs the door closed, Lumi returned to stare at the mirror, her gaze lingering on her reflection for a while. \n\nHaving just passed the Lollo Logistics assessment, she was still adjusting to city life. The city was a whirlwind compared to the quiet village she had left behind. The streets buzzed with life, day and night. Even in the dead of night, lights flickered, and voices filled the air. Walls and doors were everywhere, and restrictions at every corner. In Changzhuang, she could run free, straight through the open land for as long as she wanted. Here, every step had to be measured carefully. The crowded markets left her both energized and overwhelmed.\n\n\"Take it slow, Lumi,\" she murmured to herself. \"No rush. No rush…\"\n\nGrabbing her straw hat, Lumi took a deep breath and opened the door, ready to face the city once more."

The waves crashed against the hull with a roar, and the violent turbulence made one feel like it might drag them into the depths. She clutched her hamster plushie tightly, closing her eyes, waiting for this tortuous journey to end.\n\nDays later, the port finally came into view, where the sea met the sky. Seagulls squawked in the distance, and Lumi exhaled a breath of relief as she stepped onto solid ground. \"Thank goodness,\" she muttered. Her two companions, Tangtang and Fulei, staggered behind her, still pale from seasickness. \n\n\"You two okay?\" Lumi ran her fingers through her curls and led them to a nearby bench for rest.\n\n\"Lumi, was it this bad when you first came to Rinascita?\" Tangtang, his head still drooping, asked.\n\nLumi chuckled. \"Oh yeah! That's why I told you to stay fit. There are places way harder to reach than this.\"\n\nTangtang groaned, nodding. \"Why did you recover so quickly? You were just as seasick as us a moment ago...\"\n\nLumi grinned, remembering her first trip here with Chengxiao. \"Trust me, I was just as bad. My legs felt weak, I wanted to throw up, and I almost swore never to set foot on a ship again!\"\n\nFulei nodded in agreement, \"The ship did rock hard. It was terrifying…\"\n\nTangtang and Fulei were newbies who just joined Lollo Logistics and were assigned to Lumi's team for training. Lollo Logistics had entrusted her with guiding them through the ropes, but leading a team? Lumi wasn't so sure she was ready for that kind of responsibility. It wasn't because she hated caring for others; she was just worried that she might not meet these hopeful newcomers' expectations. Chengxiao had always made it look easy—could she really do the same?\n \n\"Lumi,\" Tangtang said, interrupting her thoughts, \"You always talk about Chengxiao, but I've never seen her at the branch. Where is she?\"\n\n\"She doesn't work in the field anymore,\" Lumi replied softly.\n\n\"What? But didn't you say she was an 'Outstanding Navigator' every year? Why would she quit?\" Fulei asked, wide-eyed.\n\nLumi gazed up at the blue sky, the expanse above Ragunna remarkably clear. \n\n\"Because... of life,\" she explained, as she had once before in her childhood. \"Sometimes life leads you down different paths. Solaris is huge, and being in Lollo Logistics means traveling year-round. Chengxiao wanted something more stable, so she moved on.\"\n\nTangtang tilted her head. \"And what about you? Did your family mind you doing this?\"\n\n\"They had their concerns,\" Lumi admitted. \"But this is my life, and I love it—traveling, seeing new things, connecting people across Solaris. That's what Lollo Logistics is all about. Chengxiao taught me a lot, and I'll do my best to pass it on to you both.\"\n\nHer words hung in the air as the two newcomers considered them. \n\nLumi smiled. \"Life is full of comings and goings,\" she continued. \"Some people get off the ship, others get on. But as long as there are those willing to carry the torch, our 'We Promise, We Deliver' motto will keep going strong.\"\n\nLumi stood up and gave a good stretch, Squeakie perched on her shoulder, nuzzling her cheek. \"Rest for another ten minutes, then we're off. Oh, you want some famous Ragunna's triple scoop ice cream? My treat!\"\n\n\"Yes!\"\n\n\"Please!\""

        "content": "Ever since its connection to the outside world resumed, Changzhuang had experienced a dramatic change. New buildings and amenities were everywhere, yet when Lumi returned home, she felt a deep wave of nostalgia.\n\nPerhaps those who longed for change had already departed, like Lumi once before, while those who remained had maintained their old habits and daily rhythms. The sun was dipping low, and as she walked through the village, smoke from cooking fires curled lazily into the sky, mingling with the sounds of laughter and the hum of evening insects.\n\nHer parents welcomed her home, placing a steaming bowl of noodles in front of her—the meat was generous, the broth rich, supplemented by a spoonful of fragrant chili oil. \n\nLumi dug in, the heat making her cheeks flush as she slurped the noodles eagerly. Her mother chuckled softly, passing her a glass of water.\n\n\"Slow down, Lumi, no one's going to steal your food,\" her mother teased.\n\nAfter a deep sip of water and broth, she leaned back, letting out a contented sigh.\n\nHer father, seated nearby, tapped his pipe. \"Been away for a long time, huh? How's your work?\"\n\nLumi smiled. \"It's been tough, but things are getting better. Someone really helped me out—a hero from Jinzhou, actually!\"\n\nHer mother raised an eyebrow, amused. \"Oh? Our little Lumi rubbing elbows with big shots now?\"\n\nLumi laughed, her eyes bright. \"It's true! I was struggling with some work stuff, but thanks to {Male=him;Female=her}, I turned it all around. Here's what happened…\"\n \nThe next morning, with the village still shrouded in the quiet calm of dawn, Lumi left home to enjoy the morning landscape of the fields. It hadn't changed beyond recognition. It still bore the vestiges of the place that had shaped her. \n\nShe wandered without aim, lost in thought until a gentle pat on the shoulder brought her back to the present.\n\n\"Lumi? What are you doing all the way out here?\"\n\nLumi blinked and turned to see Zhangzhang, her childhood friend, standing behind her, smiling.\n\n\"Oh, Zhangzhang! I was just… reminiscing. It's been a while.\" Lumi's gaze drifted to the newly paved road winding through the hills. \"I can't even tell where we are.\"\n\nZhangzhang laughed. \"Yeah, it just got finished recently—much smoother than before, huh? It was once your favorite place, you remember?\" She shifted her gaze to the road and continued, \"Not many people come through, though. But I hear your Lollo Logistics team visits regularly.\" Zhangzhang paused, intrigued, \"Speaking of which, have you been to any cool places lately? Anything to share? You see, I've been thinking about leaving to see the world for myself as well…\"\n\nLumi nodded and began recounting her latest adventures, sharing the tales of distant cities and unknown lands with her childhood friend.\n\nWhen they parted ways, Lumi found a stone by the road and sat on it, propping her chin up as she gazed at the sky. She knew that she had to move forward—only then would she see new things, bring about change, and make a difference for others.\n\nAs night faded, the first light of morning washed over the slumbering mountains. \n\nThere in the distance, where the mountain path met the sky, the familiar silhouette of a Lollo Logistics vehicle, glimmering in the sun, was approaching Changzhuang."

It was said that the first item the child touched would predict their future interests and career path.\n \nBut that day, little Youhu ignored pens, swords, and cooking utensils, crawling straight to her mother to latch onto the family's precious heirloom—a genuine antique Ruyi ring—and refused to let go.\n \nGrowing up surrounded by antiques, Youhu's love for them blossomed. She was fascinated by everything about them, soaking up the driest, most obscure appraisal facts with a twinkle in her eye. But what she loved most was listening to the stories her parents told about the antiques.\n \nThe deep chimes of the ancient bell echoed with memories of distant times when people knelt in devotion before golden statues praying for their family's wellbeing. \n \nThe stone carvings depicted bold youths drawing their bows, warding off Tacet Discords to protect the people.\n \nYouhu's lively nature shone through as she immersed herself in the world of antiques, the Tacet Mark on her arm glowing faintly to illuminate her eyes.\n \nIn every antique, she saw a little piece of history and a glimpse into the remnants of a civilization. This magic still holds her spellbound today.\n\nChenpi, Youhu's master, often praised her talent. \"To be honest, your knowledge of antiques lacks structure. But don't worry, I'll teach you everything you need to know.\"\n \n\"What's truly valuable is your respect for the history in these antiques and your keen perception.

Craftsmanship? History? Mere afterthoughts in their pricing games.\n \nHowever, Youhu has a different approach. For her, the worth of an antique isn't measured solely in currency, but something more unique.\n \nGenuine appreciation is the first factor. Youhu enjoys facilitating deals where buyers are deeply respectful of the antiques and sellers entrust their cherished items to someone who truly appreciates them. As the antique changes hands, its frequency is mirrored in the hearts of both parties.\n \nAnother factor would be conscience. When Youhu was seven, raiders ransacked the town looking for riches. To them, antiques were just another form of loot.\n \nThe wealthy merchants and local appraisers panicked, abandoning their treasures as they escaped.\n \nThe raiders, ignorant about the true worth of these antiques, justified their plundering by saying the people here didn't deserve their treasures anyway, and such items might as well be taken somewhere they would be appreciated.\n \nBut not everyone fled. Some stood their ground, facing the raiders with steely resolve. They knew the true value of these antiques and defended them to the bitter end.\n \nAnd that brings us to the final factor. The courage to sacrifice.\n \nNow, it is Youhu's turn to make a sacrifice. Whether it is her talent, her knowledge, or the lengths she will go to recover them, she is determined to return every lost antique back to its rightful owner.\n \nIn the past, those who couldn't see the value in these relics trampled all over them. But today, Youhu's mission is to return each lost antique to where it truly belongs."

It didn't quite match the original's melody, but the crisp sound of shattering ice was delightful in its own way. She also crafted an ice Ruyi, swinging it with such gusto that she nearly smashed the nearby ice cauldron and mask!\n \nPeople often ask about her most treasured antique. Youhu always hesitates, her eyes fixed on the Ruyi ring before her. This is her family's heirloom—once shattered, but now pieced together with ice.\n \nHer mother had told her that the Ruyi ring symbolized completeness and good fortune. Youhu was mesmerized by the clear and translucent jade. But when raiders came, she could only watch as the ring and other treasures were pillaged and shipped away.\n \nThree years later, she found those plundered items displayed as trophies in a museum. Despite an exhaustive search, the Ruyi ring was nowhere to be found.\n \nIt wasn't until she stumbled into a dusty storage room that she found the ring's shattered fragments, along with a tag that read \"Low value, not for display.\" What she valued most was dismissed by those who didn't understand its true worth.\n \nHeartbroken yet determined, Youhu clutched the fragments and trudged through knee-deep snow, her tears freezing as they fell. Driven by a sudden thought, she ignored the biting cold, crouched down, and used her Forte to piece the ring back together from the ice before losing consciousness.\n \nWhen she awoke, her hands were etched with delicate snowflake patterns. The next thing she saw was a perfect, gleaming ice Ruyi ring lying beside her, as if it had been waiting for her all along."

Others are created with intent.\n \nAs the world edged toward its frozen end, those destined to face the final moment placed their hopes in a certain individual. They blessed {Male=him;Female=her}, wishing {Male=he;Female=she} would lead them to a brighter tomorrow. Yet this lonely odyssey required a timeless vessel to complete the Reverberations, and the best they could offer was an enduring tool. Thus, the Shorekeeper was born—a deliberate creation, a light blue crystal cocoon of Remnant Energy gathered from the Anchor.\n \nThe Shorekeeper knew what needed to be done long before she understood how. But a tool needs a guide. She waited aimlessly in the void until, as the sea surged to its edge, she sensed a heartbeat drawing near in the briny sea breeze.\n \nIn the stillness of the night, the Astral Modulator surveyed the land as the Lament's roars faded into the distance, leaving only {Male=his;Female=her} steady heartbeat.\n \n\"Perhaps the underground needs a sky as brilliant as the one above...\" the Modulator mused, planning the future. As {Male=he;Female=she} reached out to activate the Tethys System, an enigmatic allure from a blue crystal beckoned {Male=him;Female=her} closer. The meeting of their frequencies triggered a resonance that shattered the crystal, releasing a surge of energy that burst forth like a nebula or a butterfly emerging from its chrysalis.\n \nThe energy swirled and coalesced, taking the form of a young woman, who greeted the one who had awakened her.\n \n\"I am the Shorekeeper, a tool created for you.\"\n \n\"I will fulfill your needs and carry out your commands. I will assist you and Tethys in analyzing the origin of the Lament.\"\n \nHer voice, steady and devoid of emotion, awaited a command that did not come.\n \n\"Shorekeeper… to protect secrets and guard the shores. It's straightforward, but it hardly sounds like a name.\"\n \n\"A tool does not require a name—it is merely a title and will not affect my ability to perform.\"\n \nThey stood in silence, the Astral Modulator's golden eyes reflecting an emotion the Shorekeeper could not yet comprehend.\n \nFinally, the Astral Modulator sighed softly.\n \n\"Well, we will have plenty of time to talk about that.\""

        "title": "Beyond the Value of Life",
        "content": "The dreamer of the day glimpsed the sun in the night.\n \nBefore being confined underground as the core of Tethys, the Shorekeeper once traveled beyond the Black Shores.\n \nAt that time, civilization was steadily advancing. The Astral Modulator had established an organization called the Black Shores, recruiting new members selected by Tethys. Meanwhile, the Shorekeeper focused on recreating and analyzing the Reverberations they brought back, completing her calculations.\n \nLike an omniscient observer, the Shorekeeper could trace data to monitor any human's behavior at any time in her recreated Sonoros. She attempted to categorize and interpret humans like any other phenomenon, but quickly found herself perplexed by them. \n \nWhy do they cry in both joy and sorrow? Why do their actions so often contradict their desires? Why pursue something they know they'll regret, or persist in the impossible? How can they so easily harm others, yet sacrifice themselves without hesitation? Every time the Shorekeeper thought she was closer to understanding, an unexpected event would overturn her conclusions. Though confused, she wondered if this confusion even mattered—after all, it didn't stop her from completing her tasks. But then, the Astral Modulator gave her a mission: signs of an impending Lament had appeared, which required field research to gather data for analysis. They would go together and... see what more could be done.\n \nThe Shorekeeper followed the Modulator through the farmland of that region. It was harvest season—the soil underfoot was soft yet firm, the hanging heads of grain full and ripe, and the wind carried the sweet scent of rice. She understood these things, yet seeing them firsthand felt different. Lost in these unfamiliar sensations, the Shorekeeper was unaware that her expression mirrored the curiosity and wonder of a child stepping out of their home for the first time. The Modulator chatted warmly with the locals, their conversations filled with dialects and the hum of everyday life. A kind old woman offered them homemade food. Her skin was rough, while the baby she held had warm, sweaty fingers.\n \nBut just as Tethys predicted, the omens soon became reality, shattering the fleeting peace.\n \nThe once-friendly people fell into despair—fighting over resources, crying out in anguish, their faces twisted with desperation and fear. For the first time, the Shorekeeper witnessed the Lament herself, not through Sonoros, but in its raw, overwhelming reality.\n \nWhat surprised her even more was the Modulator. {Male=He;Female=She} led all the Resonators in resisting the Tacet Discords, encouraging everyone to hold on until reinforcements arrived. {Male=He;Female=She} was trying to alter a predetermined future, but why go to such lengths for a group of strangers? The Shorekeeper recalled the Tethys System's instructions:\n \n\"A future that has been altered is destined to be altered. Attempting to change predetermined outcomes should be avoided.\"\n \n\"I can't just stand by and do nothing. If this is the cost of reaching tomorrow, I question whether such a tomorrow is worth it.\" The golden-eyed Modulator's voice was firm.\n \n\"…Unable to process. But I will prioritize your needs,\" the Shorekeeper responded, as she expanded the Stellarealm to heal and protect.\n \nNight fell, and reinforcements finally arrived. Just as they prepared to leave, a child who had lost his parents blocked their path.\n \n\"W-wait, where are you going? I want to go with you… to fight those monsters!\"\n \nSeeing the child's bright eyes, the Modulator crouched down and pointed to the Blake Bloom on {Male=his;Female=her} attire.\n \n\"What we're about to do is too dangerous for you. But if you still want to join us when you grow up, look for someone wearing this flower.\"\n \nAs the ship sailed away, the Shorekeeper watched the child waving from the dock. Humans still perplexed her, but this time, she tried to express her confusion to the one beside her.\n \n\"Tethys didn't predict this. That child isn't a candidate we need.\"\n \n\"Not everything requires Tethys's command. Humans aren't bound by such restrictions. He may not be needed now, but in time… he'll find his own path.\"\n \n\"The freedom to choose is far more important than any answer. That's something I want to show you.\"\n \n\"I want you to see and experience these things for yourself. We aren't data or abstract concepts stored in records—you can think of us as companions.\"\n \n\"Companions…\" The Shorekeeper repeated the word, pondering its meaning. What the Modulator had said wasn't an order, nor was it an answer. Yet from that moment on, a subtle, hidden anticipation began to stir within her.\n \n\"Humans are truly complex beings… I don't yet understand them, but I hope, one day, I will.\""

        "content": "Mourn not at my resting place; I am neither there nor gone.\n \nWhen the robots mentioned the name \"Delone,\" the Shorekeeper immediately recalled all that was tied to it. This wasn't just due to her natural ability to store and record information, but because Delone was special—she was one of the few who sought out the Black Shores herself.\n \nThe first time the Shorekeeper met her, Delone was a spirited girl, brimming with enthusiasm. She had complained about how hard it was to find the Black Shores, then raised her eyebrows with a hint of pride. \"I knew it! Others must be gathering to fight against the Laments and prevent further anomalies!\"\n \nAt that time, the Astral Modulator, who once held the highest authority in the Black Shores, had not yet been absent for long, and the Shorekeeper was still able to visit the surface. When the eager girl had grabbed her hand, her determination to join the Black Shores palpable, the Shorekeeper had been unsure how to respond. She felt the girl's warm hand—hot, just like the fire in her eyes.\n \nThe Shorekeeper granted Delone eligibility to sit for the entrance exam, despite it deviating from Tethys's recruitment protocols. The Shorekeeper remembered what the Modulator had once said to her, \"Humans aren't bound by such restrictions… We aren't data or abstract concepts stored in records.\" The Shorekeeper believed the Modulator would probably have acted similarly, just to preserve the girl's burning enthusiasm. In the end, Delone passed the exam and became an official member of the Black Shores.\n \nThe Shorekeeper never imagined that they would meet again under such tragic circumstances.\n \nMore than a decade had passed, and the once fiery girl had matured into a composed woman. But now, she was reaching out to the Shorekeeper with a trembling hand, life sweeping away from a grievous wound. The Shorekeeper saw it clearly. Delone's life was fading away, and there was only one possible outcome.\n \n\"I did it,\" Delone said with a weak smile. \"I took down eight Tacet Discords in one go during the Lament. But Twala... they weren't so lucky. I was the only one left to bring the data back.\"\n \nThe time for farewell was drawing near. The other members, unaware of the Shorekeeper's true identity, assumed she was a close friend of Delone and gave them space for a final moment together.\n \n\"So much time has passed... I'm... I'm so old now... but you're just the same as before.\"\n \n\"Did I do well? I didn't disappoint you, did I?\" Delone's voice wavered with weakness, but her eyes still shone as brightly as they did when they first met. What would the Modulator have done? The Shorekeeper didn't know—there was no clear answer, no example to follow. But looking into those eyes, she felt something heavy in her chest, an indescribable emotion surging within her. It compelled her to break protocol once again, just as she had done all those years ago.\n \n\"You've done well. Very well.\"\n \nThe Shorekeeper answered, and this time, she held Delone's hand. Somehow, she knew this gesture might bring comfort to her, just as it had so many years ago.\n \n\"Thank you... Thank you, Shorekeeper,\" Delone whispered, deep relief in her voice. Then, she murmured, \"The stars... they're so bright. Will I become one of them... after this? There's so much I won't be able to see, but you will... they will...\"\n \nA tear fell from her eye, taking with it her last warmth.\n \nJust as Delone had said, the Shorekeeper transformed the frequencies of the departed into a \"star,\" leaving them within the constellations of data. She couldn't remember when she had started doing this. Time had withered the Blake Blooms and eroded the Black Shores—it had also taken the lives of those who deserved to be remembered. The ever-shining stars in the sky had become the only resting place for these fallen souls.\n \nUnder the starlit sky, the Shorekeeper stood on the shores, bathed in their glow, and gazed across the sea. Had the Modulator been right to entrust her with such authority? Had she done enough to look after the Black Shores as instructed? The answers to these questions lay with the one who had left... All that remained for her was the seemingly endless wait. And so, she waited, for time was the one thing she had in abundance."

        "content": "I offer you the kernel of myself that I have carefully preserved—a core untouched by words, untraded in dreams, and beyond the reach of time, joy, and adversity.\n \nDisaster relief alone was not enough to save those who suffered. Rather than passively collecting data after each Lament, the Modulator sought to prevent its very occurrence. {Male=He;Female=She} led the Shorekeeper and the other members in issuing warnings and taking preventive measures, despite meeting little success.\n \nTo break free from the Möbius loop and create a new reality, the Modulator proposed a daring plan.\n \nThe time for farewell drew near.\n \nThe Modulator decided to erase all memories and travel beyond the Black Shores in search of a viable solution. Those who had walked in the Modulator's footsteps naturally chose to follow {Male=him;Female=her} again.\n \nOnly the Shorekeeper remained.\n \nIt was necessary because some things could only be done by the one who remained. The future pursued by the Black Shores opposed Tethys's logic of using the Lament as a tool against itself, and a core was needed to assist with translation and computation. The Shorekeeper, who had accepted the Modulator's transferred authority, was the most suitable for this role.\n \nEveryone made their choice, and so did the Shorekeeper. As a being of energy, she decided to serve as the vessel through which all Reverberation data flowed, passing through her core into Tethys. With each analysis, each recreation, and each trace, she was no longer a bystander but someone experiencing the same disasters as those recorded in the data.\n \nGrief. Resistance. Exhaustion. Decay.\n \nBirds died in panic, their hollow eyes fixed on the earth.\n \nSuffering. Chaos. Loss. Extinction.\n \nScattered flowers were crushed to dust. Stiffened hands remained frozen in desperate grasping.\n \nFear. Loathing. Anger. Resentment.\n \nCracks spidered through her body, the sound of shattering echoing continuously within.\n \nAgony? Agony... Agony, agony!\n \nAll that had happened, was happening, and could happen, converged within her. Her light dimmed, her form losing its completeness. She could feel her body fracturing, falling apart piece by piece.\n \n\"It doesn't matter. A tool breaks, that's normal. The only distinction is whether it can still be used or not. I am just a collection of energy—once spent, another will take my place. There can always be another Shorekeeper.\"\n \nIt doesn't matter.\n \n\"Just like those predetermined choices, you too are part of the Möbius loop. The Modulator may not be aware, but you have always known, haven't you? This is the end they set for you when they gave you this mission.\"\n \nBut... why this yearning?\n \nIs this... yearning?\n \n\"I noticed your change after your first field mission.\"\n \n\"You no longer accepted everything Tethys told you. You felt confused and learned to voice that confusion.\"\n \n\"I rarely gave you direct answers to your questions. As I said, I wanted you to find your own answers. But this question is different. Before we... part ways, I want to share my thoughts with you.\"\n \n\"What does this shore mean? As the leader, I should probably say something inspiring now. But what I truly want is for this shore to be a home for every member of the Black Shores.\"\n \n\"This is where it all begins, and we are each other's companions. Now and always.\"\n \nSo... how could it not matter?\n \nThe one you awakened under the stars was me.\n \nThe one who took this form by your power was me.\n \nThe one who walked with you through the countryside was me.\n \nThe one you told to seek their own answers was me.\n \nThe one who keeps secrets, guards the shore, sustains this coast, and waits for your return is me.\n \nNot any other entity of energy, not any other being, but me.\n \nThe binding loop halted. She broke free from the sea of data that threatened to drown everything, gasping for breath. She didn't want to lose those things, didn't want to stay here, didn't want to disappear like this, because—because—\n \nI am the Shorekeeper.\n \nI am the Shorekeeper who was born because of you.\n \nI am the Shorekeeper you called a companion.\n \nI am the Shorekeeper who has been shaped by all these experiences, memories, and emotions.\n \nI am... the one and only Shorekeeper because of you."

As promised, {Male=he;Female=she} found {Male=his;Female=her} way back to the Black Shores. Though {Male=he;Female=she} had lost {Male=his;Female=her} memories, {Male=his;Female=her} choices remained unchanged—together, they corrected Tethys's errors and restored peace to the souls trapped within the Necrostar.\n \nYet, amidst the celebration, the Shorekeeper felt something more than just pure joy—there was an undercurrent of uncertainty. The paths that had been laid out by Tethys, by the Modulator, and even by herself, had reached their end. Where should she go next? As the other members reveled in their success, she quietly withdrew to the familiar shore.\n \nThe Shorekeeper wandered along the shoreline as she did so often before. This habit had formed while she waited for the Modulator's return. Sleep held little meaning for her. Instead, she preferred to stay awake, observing the shore and remembering all that time had etched into it. After all, someone needed to keep the memories alive for when the Modulator returned.\n \nTonight's walk felt much like all the others. Time in the underground seemed frozen, and the familiar stars above unchanged. As the path before her stretched on and the waves lapped gently at her feet, she reached toward the unseen horizon. Though she felt as if she were once again in a state of waiting, unsure of what to do next, she knew deep down that something had shifted.\n \nThe freedom to choose was finally and truly hers. She belonged in this world and shared it with that one person.\n \n\"Fill it with all that you desire.\" \n\"Fill it.\" \n\"Fill it.\" \n\"Fill it.\"\n \nThe stars she once guided seemed to whisper to her, their silent glow urging her to step forward into the new beginning that awaited her.\n \nFootsteps drew near, and the one who had walked with her from the very beginning appeared, ever attuned to her slightest emotions. This time, it was she who decided to break the silence first.\n \n\"My name... You once said we would have plenty of time to discuss it.\"\n \n\"So, have you decided?\"\n \n\"Shorekeeper, that's my name. Not because I guard secrets or the shore itself, but because I'm the one who watches over the roving star.\"\n \nShe paused and smiled gently.\n \n\"It represents all of me, past to present. In the future... I hope that in our story, I can be the shore where you find rest.\"\n \n\"And...\" she continued, with a rare hint of playfulness, \"those melodies we played together—I've composed a piece from them.\"\n \n\"I've given it a name... The next time I play it for you, you'll know.\""
